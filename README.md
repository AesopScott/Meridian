# Meridian

Meridian is a local orchestrator for agentic software work.

You talk to the orchestrator. The orchestrator drives worker sessions, harnesses, proof, and project motion.

## What It Is

Meridian is a proactive portfolio orchestrator and builder. It advances projects, businesses, websites, tools, and experiments until Scott's judgment is the bottleneck — not execution.

The intended model:

```
Scott → Orchestrator
Orchestrator → Workers
Workers → Harnesses
Harnesses → Heartbeat / Events
Orchestrator → Scott only for judgment bottlenecks
```

## Current State: V0 Local Brain Skeleton

This first slice makes the core concepts real in code. It does not yet include real model integrations, UI, persistence, or agent harness wiring.

### Package: `meridian_core`

```
meridian_core/
  models.py         — domain objects: Portfolio, Venture, Initiative, Objective,
                      NextMove, Harness, Heartbeat, Decision, ScottBottleneck,
                      SessionInjection, ProviderAdapter, and supporting types
  sample_state.py   — sample portfolio (Meridian, Advanced AI Concepts, CareGuide),
                      heartbeats, and provider adapters
  decisions.py      — deterministic kernel decision loop
  events.py         — in-memory event recorder
  injections.py     — SessionInjection factory
```

### What the skeleton proves

- Portfolio state → harness heartbeat → kernel decision → session injection → Scott bottleneck queue
- Blocked harnesses with known blockers produce targeted directive injections
- Scott-required next moves become bottlenecks and are never auto-advanced
- Autonomous moves with unverified proof produce verification injections
- Provider adapters carry compliance tier metadata (public-safe vs. private/disabled)

## Install and run tests

Requires Python 3.12+.

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest tests/ -v
```

## Not built yet

- Real Claude / Codex / OpenRouter model integrations
- Public model setup flow: Scott's local Max/Claude and Codex CLI logins are already configured for this development machine, but a public Meridian build must not assume that. If a selected model CLI is missing or not authenticated, Meridian should tell the user to install the relevant CLI and log in to their account instead of showing raw process errors.
- Model routing intent: each project's Prime/orchestrator should normally choose the model automatically through Relay harness logic. Manual model selection may be exposed for direct use and testing, but the expected operating mode is automated Prime/Relay decision-making.
- Real session injection (modeled only)
- UI or Electron shell
- SQLite or other persistence
- Git / worktree harness
- Browser automation
- Full workflow engine
- Public packaging
