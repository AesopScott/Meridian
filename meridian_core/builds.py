"""
Harness Build And Maturity -- first-class build identity for Meridian.

Tracks:
- Meridian overall build number
- per-harness build number
- per-harness maturity state

Build number and maturity are separate fields. A harness can churn through
many build numbers while staying at low maturity, or reach operational
maturity at a low build number.
