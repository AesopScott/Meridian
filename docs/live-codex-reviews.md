# Live Codex Reviews Queue

This file is the standing queue for Codex Reviews A, the runtime/code review session.

The build lanes build. Review lanes review.

## Required First Command For Every New Task

You must do all work inside your assigned unique worktree. You are not allowed to write to `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian` main or push/write to `main` without explicit coordinator approval. Do not move data between worktrees, branches, or the main checkout. Do not cherry-pick, copy files, stash-pop across worktrees, merge, rebase, reset, or salvage. If you believe work must move, stop and ask the coordinator. The coordinator may permit it only after verifying `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian` main is clean.

## Coordinator Override - Active Now

Goal: review current-main Build 1 DeepSeek candidate metadata presets, then Build 2 runtime-state export.

Worktree: `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\codex-reviews-a`.

Task: review current-main Ready markers in order: Build 1 DeepSeek candidate metadata preset commits `bfada8b1` and `1fcad364`, then Build 2 runtime-state export commits `93bf40dd` and `d0179bb0`. For Build 1, verify metadata-only scope, no live transport, exact `deepseek-chat` dispatch id, variant labels as metadata only, route proof refs, candidate trust/external-review states, prompt-drag defaults, evidence refs, and no Relay/Bifrost/FileMap/branch/main/Polaris leakage. For Build 2, verify pure serializable runtime-state export, permission/workflow/command summary fields, advisory-only behavior, no recovery execution, and no process/model/UI/Bifrost/FileMap/branch/main/Polaris leakage.

Proof: for Build 1, `python -m pytest tests/test_model_adapter.py -q` plus `git diff --check bfada8b1^..1fcad364`. For Build 2, `python -m pytest tests/test_session_lifecycle.py -q` plus `git diff --check 93bf40dd^..d0179bb0`.

Completion: commit only review provenance/finding/pass updates locally in `docs/live-codex-reviews.md`. If a finding exists, record the smallest focused repair route and stop. Next Candidate: return to Build 1/2 polling after these current-main reviews.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Passed

Goal: review Build 1 Relay visible prompt payload meter edge-consumer hardening.

Status: passed by Codex Reviews A on 2026-06-02 09:29 -06:00. Candidate `HEAD` is `bca290d8`, and Build 1 commits `fd2d3206` and `bca290d8` are ancestors of the assigned candidate branch.

Worktree: `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\codex-reviews-a`.

Review scope: `meridian_core/relay_executor.py`, `tests/test_relay_executor.py`, `docs/live-build-1.md`, and `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` for provenance only.

Proof commands:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_relay_executor.py -q`
- `git diff --check fd2d3206^..bca290d8`

Review result:

- Containment checks for `fd2d3206` and `bca290d8` passed on the assigned candidate branch.
- Scope check shows implementation/test changes limited to `meridian_core/relay_executor.py` and `tests/test_relay_executor.py`, with Build 1 queue provenance in `docs/live-build-1.md`.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_relay_executor.py -q` passed with 213 tests.
- `git diff --check fd2d3206^..bca290d8` passed.
- Verified Relay prompt payload meter edge handling is deterministic and display-safe for missing snapshots, missing token metadata, unknown budgets, under-1k and one-decimal-k labels, over-budget/degraded status, one-decimal budget/growth percent rounding, and signed growth deltas.
- Verified Q-mode prompt-drag warning/degraded/blocker tags, provider/model/route continuity refs, and decision-record meter fallback are preserved without exposing raw prompt text, provider response text, credentials, or model error text in consumer views.
- Verified adapter/model request payload semantics are unchanged: model calls and adapters still receive only `lane.payload`; meter evidence is attached as summary/decision-record metadata only.
- Verified no live provider calls, UI/Bifrost/FileMap/session/process edits, branch/worktree movement, main writes, or Polaris dependency was introduced.

Finding: none.

Completion: Build 1 Relay visible prompt payload meter edge-consumer hardening is review-cleared. No repair routed.

- `git diff --check a240ea4d^..15ebb598` passed.
- Verified `SessionLiveControlCommandPlanStagingRecord` is frozen, deterministic, display-safe, serializable staging metadata and `stage_live_control_command_plan_from_readiness()` only copies reviewed readiness fields into a non-executable record.
- Verified target session id, command kind, recommended action, required operation, ready flag, human-gate rationale, blockers, evidence refs, and permission state are preserved.
- Verified the staging record always forces `is_executable_now=False`, `ui_review_required=True`, `human_gate_required=True`, and includes explicit `command_plan.ui_review_required` / `staging.is_executable_now=False` / `staging.ui_review_required=True` evidence.

- `python -m pytest tests/test_relay_executor.py -q` passed with 204 tests.
- `git diff --check d6007b21^..aa926f07` passed.
- Verified `RelayProviderResultValidationEvidence` remains provider-neutral, immutable, serialization-only, and display-safe, carrying route/model/provider metadata, proof refs, output length/hash, telemetry availability statuses, warning tags, blocker tags, and validation status without storing raw provider output text.
- Verified `RelayExecutionSummary.provider_result_validation_consumer_view()` is deterministic, dedupes blocker/warning tags, and does not expose raw prompts, raw provider responses, credentials, or account internals.

## Coordinator Override - Active Now

Goal: review current-main Build 1 Model Harness metadata binding, then Build 2 workflow advisory binding.

Worktree: `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\codex-reviews-a`.

Task: review current-main Ready markers in order: Build 1 Model Harness metadata binding commits `fe51ffd6` and `0ea4ddb4`, then Build 2 workflow summary advisory binding commits `ad9a4969` and `e18c0d7b`. For Build 1, verify provider-neutral metadata binding, dispatch evidence/summary shape, external-review and evidence refs, prompt-drag/budget metadata, no raw prompt/provider/credential leakage, and no UI/Bifrost/FileMap/branch/main/Polaris scope leakage. For Build 2, verify Prime/Beacon advisory-only workflow summary consumption, blocker/evidence serialization, no recovery action execution, and no process/model/UI/Bifrost/FileMap/branch/main/Polaris leakage.

Proof: for Build 1, `python -m pytest tests/test_model_adapter.py tests/test_relay_executor.py -q` plus `git diff --check fe51ffd6^..0ea4ddb4`. For Build 2, `python -m pytest tests/test_session_lifecycle.py tests/test_prime_autonomy.py tests/test_beacon.py -q` plus `git diff --check ad9a4969^..e18c0d7b`.

Completion: commit only review provenance/finding/pass updates locally in `docs/live-codex-reviews.md`. If a finding exists, record the smallest focused repair route and stop. Next Candidate: return to Build 1/2 polling after these current-main reviews.

- Verified allow/warn dispositions permit dispatch, while demote, human-gate, block, unknown-decision, and missing-metadata outcomes fail closed before `model_call` / adapter transport.
- Verified demotion disposition records target tier, authorization state, no-silent-fallback tags, and fresh PromptPacket/Aegis rerun requirements rather than silently falling back.
- Verified `PromptPacket.model_payload()` / lane payload remains the only model-bound prompt text and scoped scans found no raw prompt, credential, provider-response, UI/Bifrost/FileMap, branch/main, model-account/process, or Polaris leakage introduced by the slice.

- `python -m pytest tests/test_relay_executor.py -q` passed with 178 tests.
- `git diff --check 3a27163b^..193ba4b2` passed.
- Verified the policy-aware Relay path adapts sealed PromptPacket and dispatch-envelope proof fields into Aegis `PromptPacketProofMetadata` and calls `evaluate_prompt_packet_proof_policy()` before delegating to provider adapter transport.
- Verified blocked or human-gated PromptPacket policy decisions raise `RelayProofGateError` before `model_call`, including unsafe evidence ids, missing proof metadata, unknown proof requirements, missing dual-lane proof, candidate Tier 3 trust, and unavailable required hashes.
- Verified clean Tier 2 dual-lane proof and clean Tier 4 human-gate approval allow dispatch while preserving `PromptPacket.model_payload()` / `RelayDispatchLane.payload` as the only model-bound prompt text.
- Verified Relay policy evidence and decision records remain display-safe and do not expose raw prompt text, credentials, raw provider responses, account internals, UI/Bifrost rendering, FileMap edits, model-account/process code, branch/main movement, or Polaris dependencies.

Completion: Build 1 Relay/Aegis PromptPacket policy runtime repair is review-cleared. No repair routed.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Finding Routed

Goal: review current-main Build 2 Session Lifecycle permission summary aggregation.

Status: finding routed by Codex Reviews A on 2026-06-01 23:14 -06:00. Current `HEAD` and `origin/main` are `333f5b6d`, and Build 2 commits `1b56a098` and `777171fe` are ancestors of current main.

Review scope: `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py`, `tests/test_session_lifecycle.py`, `docs/live-build-2.md`, and `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` for provenance only.

Proof commands:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_session_lifecycle.py -q`
- `git diff --check 1b56a098^..777171fe`

Proof result:

- Containment checks for `1b56a098` and `777171fe` passed.
- Scope check shows implementation/test changes limited to `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py` and `tests/test_session_lifecycle.py`, with queue provenance in `docs/live-build-2.md`.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_session_lifecycle.py -q` passed with 91 tests.
- `git diff --check 1b56a098^..777171fe` passed.

Finding:

- MEDIUM: `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py:846` uses `observed_at.replace(tzinfo=timezone.utc)` and `permission.unlock_expiry.replace(tzinfo=timezone.utc)` in `_permission_unlock_expired_at()`. For aware non-UTC timestamps this rewrites the clock label instead of converting the instant, so an actually expired temporary unlock can be reported unexpired in permission summaries. Repro from the review worktree: `observed_at=2026-06-02T02:00:00-06:00` (08:00 UTC) and `unlock_expiry=2026-06-02T07:00:00+00:00` returns `helper_expired=False` while normalized UTC comparison is `True`.

Smallest repair route:

- Build 2 should normalize aware datetimes with `astimezone(timezone.utc)` before comparing expiry in `_permission_unlock_expired_at()` and add a regression test using a non-UTC aware `timestamp` proving `summarize_session_permission_state()` records `permission.unlock_expired` deterministically for the same instant.

Completion: Build 2 permission summary aggregation is not review-cleared. Repair routed; review stopped before any Build 1/2 follow-on review.

- Verified the live-build marker records concrete audit evidence, changed files, tests, commit, and next-candidate routing rather than read-check-only progress.

Build 3 finding: none.

Build 1/2 poll result: no Ready marker reviewed after Build 3 pass. `docs/live-build-1.md` shows an Active Now Relay/Aegis PromptPacket policy runtime integration task; `docs/live-build-2.md` shows an Active Now Session Lifecycle permission summary aggregation task.

Build 1 review scope: `meridian_core/relay_executor.py`, `tests/test_relay_executor.py`, `docs/live-build-1.md`, and `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` for provenance only.

Build 1 proof commands:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_relay_executor.py -q`
- `git diff --check 3cffeaa2^..41582efb`

Build 1 review result:

- Containment checks for `3cffeaa2` and `41582efb` passed.
- Scope check shows implementation/test changes limited to `meridian_core/relay_executor.py` and `tests/test_relay_executor.py`, with queue provenance in `docs/live-build-1.md`.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_relay_executor.py -q` passed with 172 tests.
- `git diff --check 3cffeaa2^..41582efb` passed.
- Verified Relay decision records expose PromptPacket proof refs/status (`packet_hash`, `prompt_budget_ref`, source-lineage compliance, metadata ref, blocked tags, proof requirements, and Aegis evidence ids) as audit/display metadata.
- Verified missing or blocked packet proof metadata contributes fail-closed fallback blockers, while `RelayDispatchLane.payload` / model calls still receive only approved prompt text.
- Scoped side-effect scan found no raw prompt/proof leakage into decision metadata, credential handling, raw provider response storage, account internals, UI/Bifrost rendering, FileMap edits, Polaris dependency, branch/worktree movement, or autonomous movement in the reviewed Build 1 slice.

## Coordinator Override - Active Now

Goal: poll and review the next current-main Ready marker from Build 1, Build 2, or Build 3 after fresh lane reactivation.

Worktree: `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\codex-reviews-a`.

Task: poll current `origin/main` and the top blocks in `docs/live-build-1.md`, `docs/live-build-2.md`, and `docs/live-build-3.md`. If a real Ready marker exists, review the oldest ready slice using that lane's proof. If none is ready, report checked HEAD and make no local commit. Do not commit read-check-only progress.

Task: verify the Prime/Beacon advisory binding is pure advisory state only, preserves branch/worktree permission rules, stale heartbeat safety, review-gate human approval, and permission-boundary blocking, and does not spawn sessions, inspect live processes, move branches, call models, edit UI/Bifrost/FileMap/Polaris, or add autonomous branch movement.

Proof commands:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_session_lifecycle.py tests/test_prime_autonomy.py -q`
- `git diff --check 46c118f3^..4096f0f5`

Review result:

- `git merge-base --is-ancestor 46c118f3 HEAD` and `git merge-base --is-ancestor 4096f0f5 HEAD` passed.
- `git show --stat --oneline --name-only 46c118f3 4096f0f5` shows the implementation commit changed only `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py`, `meridian_core/prime_autonomy.py`, `tests/test_session_lifecycle.py`, and `tests/test_prime_autonomy.py`, with queue provenance in `docs/live-build-2.md`.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_session_lifecycle.py tests/test_prime_autonomy.py -q` passed with 130 tests.
- `git diff --check 46c118f3^..4096f0f5` passed.
- Verified `generate_restart_finding()`, `generate_resteer_finding()`, and `gather_prime_autonomy_input()` produce immutable advisory state and evidence without restarting, steering, inspecting, or mutating live sessions.
- Verified `select_next_action_from_session_lifecycle_advisory()` returns pause/advisory/poll actions only; restart/resteer findings remain human-gated and blocked by command-plan approval requirements.
- Verified review-gated sessions pause with human approval required, permission-boundary failures pause with blockers, and operation checks use `SessionLifecycleState.can_execute_operation()` with task-scoped permission context.
- Scoped side-effect scan found no session spawning, live process inspection, model calls, UI/Bifrost/FileMap edits, branch movement, Polaris dependency, or autonomous branch movement in the reviewed slice.

Finding: none.

Completion: Build 2 Prime/Beacon advisory binding is review-cleared. Next Candidate: bind any review findings from this advisory binding slice before unrelated Session Lifecycle work; none routed.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Passed

Goal: review Build 3 current-main FileMap maintenance movement.

Status: passed by Codex Reviews A on 2026-06-01 21:40 -06:00. Current `HEAD` and `origin/main` are `f09f0b2a`, and relevant Build 3 commits `0cfd5bfa` and `1df7e081` are ancestors of current main.

Worktree: `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\codex-reviews-a`.

Allowed review files: `meridian_core/filemap.py`, `docs/FileMap.md`, `tests/test_filemap.py`, `docs/live-build-3.md`, and `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` for review provenance only.

Task: verify the newly registered V2/domain/checklist/current-main artifacts belong in FileMap, the runtime FileMap, required-path tests, and docs mirror remain aligned, the live-build marker records real completion evidence rather than read-check-only progress, and no unrelated runtime/UI/Polaris/branch movement was introduced.

Proof commands:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py -q`
- `git diff --check 0cfd5bfa^..1df7e081`

Review result:

- `git merge-base --is-ancestor 0cfd5bfa HEAD` and `git merge-base --is-ancestor 1df7e081 HEAD` passed.
- `git show --stat --oneline --name-only 0cfd5bfa 1df7e081` shows the FileMap maintenance commit changed only `meridian_core/filemap.py`, `docs/FileMap.md`, and `tests/test_filemap.py`, with queue provenance in `docs/live-build-3.md`.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py -q` passed with 46 tests.
- `git diff --check 0cfd5bfa^..1df7e081` passed.
- Verified the newly registered V2/domain/checklist/current-main artifacts are present across runtime `make_default_map()`, `docs/FileMap.md`, and `_REQUIRED_PATHS`, including DeepSeek, Relay, Aegis, PromptPacket, live-build queue, orchestrator, Echo/Atlas, and Session Lifecycle permission artifacts.
- Verified `docs/live-build-3.md` records concrete completion evidence: registered artifacts, changed files, test proof, commit evidence, audit result, and Ready marker. The marker names worker commit `25bc316b`; its FileMap content matches current-main commit `0cfd5bfa`, so the current-main review target is equivalent and proofable.
- Scoped diff/side-effect scan found no unrelated runtime behavior, UI/Bifrost/Polaris dependency, live process/model/account code, branch movement, or cross-worktree movement in the reviewed slice.

Finding: none.

Completion: Build 3 FileMap maintenance movement is review-cleared. Next Candidate: bind any review findings from this FileMap slice before unrelated FileMap cleanup; none routed.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Passed

Goal: review Build 1 DeepSeek candidate metadata preset slice when it is marked Ready for Codex Review on current main.

Status: passed by Codex Reviews A on 2026-06-01 21:30 -06:00. Current `HEAD` and `origin/main` are `00c4ab0d`, and relevant Build 1 commits `d41e33cd` and `0b7f1bc4` are ancestors of current main.

Worktree: `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\codex-reviews-a`.

Required first command for this task: verify you are in your assigned unique worktree and not in `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian`; you are not allowed to write to main, move data between worktrees or branches, cherry-pick, copy files, stash-pop across worktrees, merge, rebase, reset, or salvage without coordinator approval.

Allowed review files: `meridian_core/model_adapter.py`, `tests/test_model_adapter.py`, `docs/model-harness-v2-contract.md`, `docs/deepseek-provider-validation-gate.md`, `docs/deepseek-direct-provider-implementation-handoff.md`, `docs/live-build-1.md`, and `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` for review provenance/routing only.

Task: poll `docs/live-build-1.md` and current `origin/main` for the Build 1 DeepSeek candidate metadata preset completion. When Build 1 marks the slice Ready for Codex Review on a current-main commit, verify the Model Harness can represent DeepSeek direct-provider candidate routes for a default quality lane and fast lane while preserving validation-gate constraints: DeepSeek remains candidate trust, cannot clear reviews, cannot move branches, cannot bypass Relay/Aegis, and cannot run autonomous coding lanes until validation proof exists. Verify `deepseek-chat` remains the direct API dispatch id and any `deepseek-v4-pro` / `deepseek-v4-flash` labels are metadata/variant labels only, not dispatch keys. Confirm no network access, credentials, live model calls, UI/Bifrost rendering, branch movement, or Polaris dependency was added.

Proof command:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_model_adapter.py -q`

Review result:

- `git merge-base --is-ancestor d41e33cd HEAD` and `git merge-base --is-ancestor 0b7f1bc4 HEAD` passed.
- `git show --stat --oneline --name-only d41e33cd 0b7f1bc4` shows the runtime commit only changed `meridian_core/model_adapter.py` and `tests/test_model_adapter.py`, with queue provenance in `docs/live-build-1.md`.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_model_adapter.py -q` passed with 32 tests.
- Verified `deepseek_candidate_route_presets()` provides `default_quality` and `fast` candidate lanes, keeps `deepseek-chat` as the sole dispatch model, and keeps `deepseek-v4-pro` / `deepseek-v4-flash` as metadata variant labels only.
- Verified DeepSeek remains candidate trust with external review pending and explicit blocks for review clearance, branch movement, Relay/Aegis bypass, and autonomous coding.
- Scoped side-effect scan found no new network/live model call path, credentials handling, UI/Bifrost rendering, branch movement, or Polaris dependency in the reviewed slice.

Finding: none.

Completion: Build 1 DeepSeek candidate metadata preset slice is review-cleared. Next Relay/Model Harness candidate for coordinator/Prime selection from `docs/v2-progress-tracker.md`: continue remaining Relay/Model Harness build work such as visible prompt payload meter wiring or metadata/pass-through hardening; DeepSeek must remain candidate-gated until validation proof exists.

Completion: if clean, mark passed and promote the next Relay/Model Harness candidate from `docs/v2-progress-tracker.md`; if findings exist, route the smallest focused repair to Build 1 ahead of unrelated Relay work. Commit only review-queue/provenance updates and push to `origin/main`.

## Next Candidate Task - Completed / Passed

Goal: review Build 2 Session Lifecycle restart/resteer recovery tests when marked Ready for Codex Review on current main.

Status: passed by Codex Reviews A on 2026-06-01 21:30 -06:00. Current `HEAD` and `origin/main` are `00c4ab0d`, and relevant Build 2 commits `636d946c` and `2b7011fb` are ancestors of current main.

Allowed review files: `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py`, `tests/test_session_lifecycle.py`, `docs/session-lifecycle-v2-contract.md`, `docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md`, `docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-prime-beacon-contract.md`, `docs/live-build-2.md`, and `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` for review provenance/routing only.

Task: after the active Build 1 DeepSeek candidate metadata preset review is passed or repair-routed, poll `docs/live-build-2.md` and current `origin/main` for the Build 2 restart/resteer recovery test slice. Verify the tests cover stale heartbeat, context-fill summarize/reset, reasoning-shift transfer/start-new-session, review-gate human approval, and permission-boundary blocking while preserving reviewed permission invariants and no-live-control boundaries.

Proof command:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_session_lifecycle.py -q`

Review result:

- `git merge-base --is-ancestor 636d946c HEAD` and `git merge-base --is-ancestor 2b7011fb HEAD` passed.
- `git show --stat --oneline --name-only 636d946c 2b7011fb` shows the test commit only changed `tests/test_session_lifecycle.py`, with queue provenance in `docs/live-build-2.md`.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_session_lifecycle.py -q` passed with 65 tests.
- Verified recovery coverage for stale heartbeat restart advisory/gated plan, context-fill summarize/reset and start-new paths, reasoning-shift start-new plus transfer recovery, review-gate human approval, and permission-boundary blocking with expiry/task-scope invariants preserved.
- Scoped side-effect scan found no session spawning, live process inspection, model calls, UI/Bifrost/FileMap edits, branch movement, or Polaris dependency in the reviewed slice.

Finding: none.

Completion: Build 2 restart/resteer recovery test slice is review-cleared. Next Session Lifecycle candidate for coordinator/Prime selection from `docs/v2-progress-tracker.md`: wire the restart/resteer evaluator into Prime/Beacon runtime state while preserving branch/worktree permission boundaries.

Completion: if clean, mark passed and promote the next Session Lifecycle candidate from `docs/v2-progress-tracker.md`; if findings exist, route the smallest focused repair to Build 2 ahead of unrelated Session Lifecycle work. Commit only review-queue/provenance updates and push to `origin/main`.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Passed

Goal: review current-main Build 2 Session Lifecycle permission-invariant repair.

Status: passed by Codex Reviews A on 2026-06-01 19:23 -06:00. Current `HEAD` and `origin/main` contain Build 2 repair commit `e41851ae`, and the prior HIGH permission-invariant findings are closed.

Review result:

- `git merge-base --is-ancestor e41851ae HEAD` and `git merge-base --is-ancestor e41851ae origin/main` passed.
- `git show --stat --oneline --name-only e41851ae` shows the repair commit only changed `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py` and `tests/test_session_lifecycle.py`.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_session_lifecycle.py -q` passed with 60 tests.
- Closed: invalid temporary/permanent `PermissionContext` states are rejected; temporary unlocks require expiry and task scope; permanent unlocks require dual approval; work acceptance and operation execution enforce expiry/task scope against the session's current task id.
- Scoped side-effect scan found no subprocess/session spawning, live process inspection, model calls, UI/Bifrost/FileMap edits, branch movement, or Polaris dependency in `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py` / `tests/test_session_lifecycle.py`.

Finding: none.

Completion: Build 2 Session Lifecycle permission-invariant repair is review-cleared. Build 2 is released to the next Session Lifecycle restart/resteer recovery test slice in `docs/live-build-2.md`. The prior next-candidate Build 1 checklist commit `455ed63c` is not on current `main`, so Reviews A is now tracking the current Build 1 DeepSeek metadata preset slice instead of reviving stale branch movement.

Worktree: `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\codex-reviews-a`.

Required first command for this task: verify you are in your assigned unique worktree and not in `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian`; you are not allowed to write to main, move data between worktrees or branches, cherry-pick, copy files, stash-pop across worktrees, merge, rebase, reset, or salvage without coordinator approval.

Allowed review files: `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py`, `tests/test_session_lifecycle.py`, `docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md`, `docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-prime-beacon-contract.md`, `docs/live-build-2.md`, and `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` for review provenance/routing only.

Task: review current `origin/main` commit `e41851ae` for the Build 2 repair of the remaining Session Lifecycle permission-invariant gaps. Verify invalid temporary/permanent `PermissionContext` states are rejected; temporary unlocks require expiry and task scope; permanent unlocks require dual approval; `can_accept_work()` and `can_execute_operation()` enforce expiry and task scope against the current session task id; closed heartbeat and immutable PrimeAutonomyInput repairs remain intact; and no live process control, model calls, UI/Bifrost/FileMap edits, branch movement, or Polaris dependency was added.

Proof command:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_session_lifecycle.py -q`

Completion: if clean, mark passed, close the prior HIGH permission-invariant findings, and leave the next executable Reviews A candidate: review Build 1 Relay proof payload downstream-consumer checklist commit `455ed63c`. If findings exist, route the smallest focused repair back to Build 2 ahead of normal work. Commit only review-queue/provenance updates and push to `origin/main`.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Repair-Routed

Goal: review current-main Build 2 Session Lifecycle permissions contract-completeness repair.

Status: repair routed by Codex Reviews A on 2026-06-01 18:21 -06:00. Current `HEAD` and `origin/main` contain Build 2 repair commit `e486de2d`, and the required proof passes, but two permission-gate invariants remain incomplete.

Review result:

- `git merge-base --is-ancestor e486de2d HEAD` and `git merge-base --is-ancestor e486de2d origin/main` passed.
- `git show --stat --oneline --name-only e486de2d` and `git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-only -r e486de2d` show the repair commit only changed `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py` and `tests/test_session_lifecycle.py`.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_session_lifecycle.py -q` passed with 52 tests.
- Closed: `heartbeat_stale()` now uses `last_prompt_sent_at` with seconds semantics, and `PrimeAutonomyInput` stores immutable tuple/frozenset containers with defensive serialized lists/dicts.
- Scoped side-effect scan found no subprocess/session spawning, live process inspection, model calls, UI/Bifrost/FileMap edits, branch movement, or Polaris dependency.

Findings:

- HIGH: `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py:144` - `PermissionContext` now has `approved_by_secondary`, `unlock_expiry`, and `task_scope`, but it still has no construction-time invariants enforcing the checklist requirements that temporary unlocks have explicit expiry/task scope and permanent unlocks require Aegis + Scott/two independent approvers (`docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md:123`, `docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md:124`, `docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md:186`, `docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md:187`). Required repair: Build 2 must enforce these invariants in construction/helper paths and add regression tests proving invalid temporary/permanent permission contexts are rejected.
- HIGH: `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py:318` and `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py:397` - `can_accept_work()` checks locked/expired permission state but cannot enforce `task_scope`, and `SessionLifecycleState.can_execute_operation()` bypasses `PermissionContext.can_execute_operation()` so it ignores unlock expiry and task scope entirely. This leaves the prior permission-boundary finding partially open against checklist requirements for expiry, task scope, and approval-scope filtering (`docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md:101`, `docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md:127`, `docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md:153`, `docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md:154`). Required repair: Build 2 must pass/currently use the session task id through permission checks and add tests proving expired or out-of-scope unlocks cannot accept work or execute operations.

Completion: routed the narrower permission-invariant repair to Build 2 in `docs/live-build-2.md`. No implementation files were changed by Reviews A. Next Candidate: no executable Reviews A task remains until Build 2 provides a current-main repair target.

Worktree: `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\codex-reviews-a`.

Allowed review files: `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py`, `tests/test_session_lifecycle.py`, `docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md`, `docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-prime-beacon-contract.md`, `docs/live-build-2.md`, and `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` for provenance/routing only.

Task: review current `origin/main` commit `e486de2d` for the Build 2 Session Lifecycle permissions contract-completeness repair. Verify the prior HIGH/MEDIUM findings are closed: `PermissionContext` includes secondary approval, unlock expiry, and task scope with invariants/tests; `SessionLifecycleState.can_accept_work()` enforces permission lock, expiry, and scope; `heartbeat_stale()` uses the reviewed prompt-sent/seconds semantics or explicitly reconciles contract language; and `PrimeAutonomyInput` no longer exposes mutable containers by reference. Confirm `python -m pytest tests/test_session_lifecycle.py -q` passes and no live process control, model calls, UI/Bifrost/FileMap edits, branch movement, or Polaris dependency was added. If findings exist, route the smallest focused repair to Build 2; otherwise mark passed and leave a concrete Next Candidate.

Proof command:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_session_lifecycle.py -q`

Completion: commit only review-queue/provenance updates, push to `origin/main`, and leave a concrete Next Candidate.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Repair-Routed

Goal: review current-main Build 2 Session Lifecycle permissions and Prime/Beacon binding implementation.

Status: repair routed by Codex Reviews A on 2026-06-01 18:14 -06:00. Current `HEAD` and `origin/main` contain Build 2 commit `7e96994a`, and the required proof passes, but the implementation does not yet satisfy the reviewed permissions/Prime-Beacon checklist invariants.

Review result:

- `git merge-base --is-ancestor 7e96994a HEAD` and `git merge-base --is-ancestor 7e96994a origin/main` passed.
- `git show --stat --oneline --name-only 7e96994a` and `git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-only -r 7e96994a` show the implementation commit only changed `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py` and `tests/test_session_lifecycle.py`.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_session_lifecycle.py -q` passed with 52 tests.
- Scoped side-effect scan found no subprocess/session spawning, live process inspection, model calls, UI/Bifrost/FileMap edits, branch movement, or Polaris dependency in `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py` / `tests/test_session_lifecycle.py`.

Findings:

- HIGH: `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py:144` - `PermissionContext` omits the reviewed checklist fields and invariants for `approved_by_secondary`, `unlock_expiry`, and `task_scope` (`docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md:16`, `docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md:21`, `docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md:22`, `docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md:186`, `docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md:187`). Without expiry/task scope and dual-signer support, temporary unlocks are not timestamp-bound/task-scoped and permanent unlocks cannot require Aegis + Scott approval. Required repair: Build 2 must add the missing fields/invariants and regression tests for expiry, task scope, and dual-signer permanent unlocks.
- HIGH: `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py:292` - `SessionLifecycleState.can_accept_work()` ignores `permission_context`, so a healthy locked session can still accept work despite the checklist requiring `can_accept_work()` to be false while permission is locked or an unlock is expired (`docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md:101`, `docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md:151`, `docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md:153`, `docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md:154`). Required repair: Build 2 must make work acceptance enforce permission lock, expiry, and task scope, with tests proving locked/expired/out-of-scope sessions cannot accept work.
- MEDIUM: `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py:305` - `heartbeat_stale()` uses `last_queue_read_at` and a minutes threshold, but the permissions checklist defines staleness from `last_prompt_sent_at` with a seconds threshold (`docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md:37`, `docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md:102`, `docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md:132`, `docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md:133`). Required repair: Build 2 must align heartbeat staleness with `last_prompt_sent_at` / seconds semantics or update the reviewed contract before implementation.
- MEDIUM: `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py:206` - `PrimeAutonomyInput` is a frozen dataclass but stores mutable `list`/`dict` fields and `to_dict()` returns those containers by reference at `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py:220` through `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py:223`. This violates the checklist's immutable/deterministic Prime input requirement (`docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md:147`, `docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md:181`, `docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md:190`). Required repair: Build 2 must normalize Prime input containers to immutable representations or defensive copies and add mutation-resistance tests.

Completion: routed the focused contract-completeness repair to Build 2 in `docs/live-build-2.md`. No implementation files were changed by Reviews A. Next Candidate: no executable Reviews A task remains until Build 2 provides a current-main repair target.

Worktree: `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\codex-reviews-a`.

Allowed review files: `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py`, `tests/test_session_lifecycle.py`, `docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-prime-beacon-contract.md`, `docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md`, `docs/session-lifecycle-v2-contract.md`, `docs/live-build-2.md`, and `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` for provenance/routing only.

Task: review current `origin/main` commit `7e96994a` for the Build 2 Session Lifecycle permissions and Prime/Beacon binding implementation. Verify the typed/frozen PermissionState, OperationScope, FindingType, PermissionContext, RestartResteerFinding, and PrimeAutonomyInput surfaces match the reviewed contracts/checklists; SessionLifecycleState preserves existing command-plan behavior and unique-worktree/assigned-queue invariants; permission helpers block or require approval for scoped operations correctly; Beacon findings and Prime selection inputs are represented without live process control. Confirm `python -m pytest tests/test_session_lifecycle.py -q` passes and the change does not spawn sessions, inspect live processes, call models, edit UI/Bifrost/FileMap/review queues beyond provenance, move branches, or touch Polaris. If findings exist, route the smallest focused repair to Build 2; otherwise mark passed and leave a concrete Next Candidate.

Proof command:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_session_lifecycle.py -q`

Completion: commit only review-queue/provenance updates, push to `origin/main`, and leave a concrete Next Candidate.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Repair-Routed

Goal: review Build 2 Session Lifecycle permissions and Prime/Beacon binding implementation.

Status: repair routed by Codex Reviews A on 2026-06-01 18:08 -06:00. The assigned implementation commit `6e2f2a5f` exists locally, but it is not an ancestor of current `HEAD` / `origin/main`, so Reviews A cannot run the required proof command against the queued implementation slice on current main.

Review result:

- `git merge-base --is-ancestor 6e2f2a5f HEAD` failed.
- `git merge-base --is-ancestor 6e2f2a5f origin/main` failed.
- `git branch --contains 6e2f2a5f --all` shows the commit only on `worktree-build-2-session-lifecycle` and `origin/worktree-build-2-session-lifecycle`.
- `git show --stat --oneline --name-only 6e2f2a5f` shows the worker commit changed only `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py` and `tests/test_session_lifecycle.py`.
- `git diff --stat 6e2f2a5f..HEAD -- meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py tests/test_session_lifecycle.py` shows current main lacks the queued permissions/Prime-Beacon binding implementation and tests, so running `python -m pytest tests/test_session_lifecycle.py -q` here would not prove the assigned slice.

Finding:

- HIGH: review provenance/branch visibility - Build 2 implementation commit `6e2f2a5f` is not reviewable on current `origin/main`. Required repair: Build 2/coordinator must land the intended Session Lifecycle permissions and Prime/Beacon binding implementation on current main through the approved path or requeue a current-main review target; then Reviews A can rerun `python -m pytest tests/test_session_lifecycle.py -q` and verify the typed/frozen permission, Beacon finding, Prime autonomy input, command-plan invariant, and no-live-process-control requirements.

Completion: routed the focused visibility repair to Build 2 in `docs/live-build-2.md`. No implementation files were changed by Reviews A. Next Candidate: no executable Reviews A task remains until Build 2/coordinator provides a current-main review target.

Worktree: `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\codex-reviews-a`.

Allowed review files: `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py`, `tests/test_session_lifecycle.py`, `docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-prime-beacon-contract.md`, `docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md`, `docs/session-lifecycle-v2-contract.md`, `docs/live-build-2.md`, and `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` for provenance/routing only.

Task: review current `origin/main` Build 2 commit `6e2f2a5f` for the Session Lifecycle permissions and Prime/Beacon binding implementation. Verify the typed/frozen PermissionState, OperationScope, FindingType, PermissionContext, RestartResteerFinding, and PrimeAutonomyInput surfaces match the reviewed contracts/checklists; SessionLifecycleState preserves existing command-plan behavior and unique-worktree/assigned-queue invariants; permission helpers block or require approval for scoped operations correctly; Beacon findings and Prime selection inputs are represented without live process control. Confirm `python -m pytest tests/test_session_lifecycle.py -q` passes and the change does not spawn sessions, inspect live processes, call models, edit UI/Bifrost/FileMap/review queues beyond provenance, move branches, or touch Polaris. If findings exist, route the smallest focused repair to Build 2; otherwise mark passed and leave a concrete Next Candidate.

Proof command:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_session_lifecycle.py -q`

Completion: commit only review-queue/provenance updates, push to `origin/main`, and leave a concrete Next Candidate.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Passed

Goal: review Build 1 Relay proof payload deterministic test-collection repair.

Status: passed by Codex Reviews A on 2026-06-01 18:02 -06:00. Current `HEAD` and `origin/main` contain Build 1 repair commit `0641aa44`, and the duplicate deterministic test collection finding is closed.

Review result:

- `git merge-base --is-ancestor 0641aa44 HEAD` and `git merge-base --is-ancestor 0641aa44 origin/main` passed.
- `git show --stat --oneline --name-only 0641aa44` shows the repair commit only changed `tests/test_relay_executor.py`.
- `git show --stat --oneline --name-only 708a5f7e` shows the Build 1 provenance marker only changed `docs/live-build-1.md`.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_relay_executor.py -q` passed with 152 tests.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_relay_executor.py::TestAegisGateEvidenceSummary --collect-only -q` collected 19 tests, including both `test_evidence_summary_to_dict_multiple_calls_identical` and `test_evidence_summary_to_dict_multiple_calls_identical_with_partial_evidence`.

Finding: none. Prior MEDIUM duplicate test method name / collection shadowing finding is closed.

Completion: Build 1 Relay proof payload deterministic test-collection repair is review-cleared. Next Candidate: no executable Reviews A task remains; continue polling for the next coordinator-promoted Ready marker.

Worktree: `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\codex-reviews-a`.

Allowed review files: `tests/test_relay_executor.py`, `docs/live-build-1.md`, and `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` for provenance/routing only.

Task: review current `origin/main` commit `0641aa44` and Build 1 queue marker `708a5f7e` for the focused test-only repair to the Relay proof payload negative-path deterministic test collection. Verify the duplicate `TestAegisGateEvidenceSummary.test_evidence_summary_to_dict_multiple_calls_identical` shadowing issue is fixed by a uniquely named deterministic incomplete/partial-evidence test, `python -m pytest tests/test_relay_executor.py -q` passes, and `python -m pytest tests/test_relay_executor.py::TestAegisGateEvidenceSummary --collect-only -q` collects the repaired test without duplicate-name shadowing. Confirm the repair changed only `tests/test_relay_executor.py` plus queue provenance and added no Relay runtime, Bifrost, Aegis, Session Lifecycle, FileMap, UI, process/model/account code, branch movement, or Polaris dependency. If findings exist, route the smallest focused repair to Build 1; otherwise mark passed and leave a concrete Next Candidate.

Proof commands:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_relay_executor.py -q`
- `python -m pytest tests/test_relay_executor.py::TestAegisGateEvidenceSummary --collect-only -q`

Completion: commit only review-queue/provenance updates, push to `origin/main`, and leave a concrete Next Candidate. Do not edit implementation files from the review worktree.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Repair-Routed

Goal: review current-main Build 1 Relay proof payload negative-path tests after visibility repair.

Status: repair routed by Codex Reviews A on 2026-06-01 17:53 -06:00. Current `HEAD` and `origin/main` contain worker commit `26a71632` and merge commit `6de2c4d5`, and the required Relay executor proof passes, but one test collection gap remains in the landed negative-path test slice.

Review result:

- `git merge-base --is-ancestor 26a71632 HEAD` and `git merge-base --is-ancestor 26a71632 origin/main` passed.
- `git merge-base --is-ancestor 6de2c4d5 origin/main` passed.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_relay_executor.py -q` passed with 151 tests.
- `git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-only -r 26a71632` shows the worker commit only changed `tests/test_relay_executor.py`.
- The added tests cover empty evidence IDs, absent waiver default, demote/no blockers, empty explanation with a decision, no gate decision shape, and mixed empty/full evidence fields.

Finding:

- MEDIUM: `tests/test_relay_executor.py` defines `TestAegisGateEvidenceSummary.test_evidence_summary_to_dict_multiple_calls_identical` twice. The later existing definition shadows the newly added negative-path deterministic test, and `python -m pytest tests/test_relay_executor.py::TestAegisGateEvidenceSummary --collect-only -q` collects only one method with that name. Required repair: Build 1 should rename the newly added deterministic negative-path test, or otherwise add a uniquely named test that proves deterministic immutable `to_dict()` output for incomplete/partial evidence. Keep the repair test-only unless coordinator expands scope.

Completion: routed the focused test-collection repair to Build 1 in `docs/live-build-1.md`. No implementation files were changed by Reviews A. Next Candidate: no executable Reviews A task remains until Build 1 provides the repair target.

Worktree: `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\codex-reviews-a`.

Allowed review files: `tests/test_relay_executor.py`, `meridian_core/relay_executor.py`, `docs/live-build-1.md`, and `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` for provenance/routing only.

Task: review current `origin/main` containing Build 1 merge commit `6de2c4d5` and worker commit `26a71632` for the Relay proof payload negative-path tests. First verify `26a71632` is now an ancestor of current `HEAD` / `origin/main`, then run the proof command. Confirm the added tests cover incomplete/empty evidence ids, absent waiver/approval evidence, fallback blockers, no-gate/blocked decision shape, and deterministic immutable output for incomplete evidence. Confirm no Bifrost, Aegis, Session Lifecycle, FileMap, UI, process/model/account code, branch movement, or Polaris dependency was added. If findings exist, route the smallest focused repair to Build 1; otherwise mark passed and leave a concrete Next Candidate.

Proof command:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_relay_executor.py -q`

Completion: commit only review-queue/provenance updates, push to `origin/main`, and leave a concrete Next Candidate. Do not edit implementation files from the review worktree.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Repair-Routed

Goal: review Build 1 Relay proof payload negative-path tests.

Status: repair routed by Codex Reviews A on 2026-06-01 17:45 -06:00. The assigned worker commit `26a71632` exists, but it is not an ancestor of current `HEAD` / `origin/main`, so Reviews A cannot run the required proof command against the queued test slice on current main.

Review result:

- `git merge-base --is-ancestor 26a71632 HEAD` failed, proving the assigned test commit is not present in current main.
- `git branch --contains 26a71632 --all` shows the commit only on `worktree-build-1-v2-relay` and `origin/worktree-build-1-v2-relay`.
- `git show --stat --oneline --name-only 26a71632` shows the worker commit changes only `tests/test_relay_executor.py`.
- `git diff --stat 26a71632..HEAD -- tests/test_relay_executor.py meridian_core/relay_executor.py` shows current main lacks the queued negative-path test additions, so running `python -m pytest tests/test_relay_executor.py -q` here would not prove the assigned slice.

Finding:

- HIGH: review provenance/branch visibility - Build 1 worker commit `26a71632` is not reviewable on current `origin/main`. Required repair: Build 1/coordinator must land the negative-path test commit on current main through the approved path or requeue a current-main review target, then Reviews A can rerun `python -m pytest tests/test_relay_executor.py -q` and verify the required incomplete-evidence, absent-evidence, fallback-blocker, no-gate/blocked-shape, and deterministic immutable-output coverage.

Completion: routed the focused visibility repair to Build 1 in `docs/live-build-1.md`. No implementation files were changed by Reviews A. Next Candidate: no executable Reviews A task remains until Build 1/coordinator provides a current-main review target.

Worktree: `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\codex-reviews-a`.

Allowed review files: `tests/test_relay_executor.py`, `meridian_core/relay_executor.py`, `docs/live-build-1.md`, and `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` for provenance/routing only.

Task: review Build 1 worker commit `26a71632` for the Relay proof payload negative-path tests. Verify the commit is present on the reviewable branch/current main or route a visibility repair if it is not. If reviewable, run `python -m pytest tests/test_relay_executor.py -q`, confirm the added tests cover incomplete/empty evidence ids, absent waiver/approval evidence, fallback blockers, no-gate/blocked decision shape, and deterministic immutable output for incomplete evidence. Confirm no Bifrost, Aegis, Session Lifecycle, FileMap, UI, process/model/account code, branch movement, or Polaris dependency was added. If findings exist, route the smallest focused repair to Build 1; otherwise mark passed and leave a concrete Next Candidate.

Proof command:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_relay_executor.py -q`

Completion: commit only review-queue/provenance updates, push to `origin/main`, and leave a concrete Next Candidate.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Passed

Goal: review current-main Build 2 Prime command-plan tests after coordinator provenance repair.

Status: passed by Codex Reviews A on 2026-06-01 17:32 -06:00. Current `origin/main` contains coordinator-scoped repair commit `17d70c9d`, and the required Session Lifecycle proof passes with the added Prime command-plan coverage.

Review result:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_session_lifecycle.py -q` passed with 34 tests.
- `git merge-base --is-ancestor 17d70c9d HEAD` passed, proving the reviewed current-main repair commit is present.
- `git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-only -r 17d70c9d` shows the repair commit only changed `tests/test_session_lifecycle.py`.
- `tests/test_session_lifecycle.py` now covers command-plan consumption for archive, request-human-gate, summarize/reset, transfer, context-fill, review-gate, and permission-boundary routing signals through typed helpers and command intents.
- Scoped inspection found no live session spawning, model calls, process control, UI work, branch movement by the worker, or Polaris dependency in the reviewed commit.

Finding: none. The prior HIGH review provenance/branch visibility finding is closed.

Completion: Build 2 Prime command-plan test repair is review-cleared. Next Candidate: no executable Reviews A task remains; continue polling for the next coordinator-promoted Ready marker.

Worktree: `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\codex-reviews-a`.

Allowed review files: `tests/test_session_lifecycle.py`, `docs/live-build-2.md`, and `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` for provenance/routing only.

Task: review current `origin/main` commit `17d70c9d`, the coordinator-scoped cherry-pick of Build 2 worker commit `f69d6683`, for the Prime command-plan tests consuming Session Lifecycle routing actions/reasons. Verify the commit is now an ancestor of current `HEAD` / `origin/main`, `python -m pytest tests/test_session_lifecycle.py -q` passes with the added command-plan coverage, and the change is limited to `tests/test_session_lifecycle.py`. Confirm no live session spawning, model calls, process control, UI work, branch movement by the worker, or Polaris dependency was added. If findings exist, route the smallest focused repair to Build 2; otherwise mark passed and leave a concrete Next Candidate.

Proof command:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_session_lifecycle.py -q`

Completion: commit only review-queue/provenance updates, push to `origin/main`, and leave a concrete Next Candidate.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Repair-Routed

Goal: review Build 2 Prime command-plan tests for Session Lifecycle routing actions and reasons.

Status: repair routed by Codex Reviews A on 2026-06-01 17:27 -06:00. The assigned commit `f69d6683` exists locally, but it is not an ancestor of current `HEAD` / `origin/main`, so the required proof command executed current-main tests rather than the queued Build 2 test slice.

Review result:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_session_lifecycle.py -q` passed with 24 tests in the current checkout.
- `git merge-base --is-ancestor f69d6683 HEAD` failed, proving the reviewed Ready marker commit is not present in current `HEAD` / `origin/main`.
- `git branch --contains f69d6683 --all` shows the commit only on `worktree-build-2-session-lifecycle`.
- `git diff --stat f69d6683..HEAD -- tests/test_session_lifecycle.py meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py` shows current `HEAD` lacks the queued commit's added test content.

Finding:

- HIGH: review provenance/branch visibility - Reviews A cannot clear Build 2 commit `f69d6683` because it is not present on current `origin/main`. Required repair: Build 2/coordinator must land the intended Prime command-plan test commit on `origin/main` through the approved path or requeue a current-main review target; then Reviews A can rerun `python -m pytest tests/test_session_lifecycle.py -q` and verify the typed command-plan coverage.

Completion: routed the focused provenance/visibility repair to Build 2 in this review queue. No implementation files were changed by Reviews A.

Worktree: `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\codex-reviews-a`.

Allowed review files: `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py`, `tests/test_session_lifecycle.py`, `docs/live-build-2.md`, and `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` for provenance/routing only.

Task: review current `origin/main` commit `f69d6683` and the Build 2 queue marker for the Prime command-plan tests consuming Session Lifecycle routing actions/reasons. Verify the tests prove Prime-facing command plans can consume archive, request-human-gate, summarize/reset, transfer, context-fill, review-gate, and permission-boundary routing signals through typed helpers only. Confirm no live session spawning, model calls, process control, UI work, branch movement, or Polaris dependency was added. If findings exist, route the smallest focused repair to Build 2; otherwise mark passed and leave a concrete Next Candidate.

Proof command:

Completion: commit only review-queue/provenance updates, push to `origin/main`, and leave a concrete Next Candidate.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Passed

Goal: review Build 2 Session Lifecycle routing-action repair implementation.

Status: passed by Codex Reviews A on 2026-06-01 16:39 -06:00. Build 2 repair commit `558af555` closes the prior archive/request-human-gate action and required reason coverage findings.

Review result:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_session_lifecycle.py -q` passed with 24 tests.
- `git merge-base --is-ancestor 558af555 HEAD` passed, proving the reviewed repair commit is present in the current checkout.
- `SessionAction` now represents `ARCHIVE` and `REQUEST_HUMAN_GATE` in addition to reuse/start/summarize/transfer/avoid.
- `suggest_routing_action()` now exposes context-fill, review-gate, and permission-boundary reasons through typed routing paths, and regression tests cover archive, human-gate review, human-gate permission boundary, and context-fill start-new routing.
- Unique-worktree, assigned-queue, and branch-permission fields remain present in `SessionLifecycleState` / `SessionCommandPlan`; scoped side-effect scan found no live process control, model calls, UI calls, branch movement, or Polaris dependency.

Finding: none. Prior HIGH action-surface and MEDIUM reason-coverage findings are closed in the scoped repair review.

Completion: Build 2 Session Lifecycle routing-action repair is review-cleared. Build 3 FileMap registration for Relay proof payload contract docs remains the next review candidate.

Worktree: `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\codex-reviews-a`.

Allowed review files: `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py`, `tests/test_session_lifecycle.py`, `docs/live-build-2.md`, and `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` for provenance/routing only.

Task: verify current `origin/main` commit `558af555` against the repaired Build 2 contract. Confirm Prime can represent Relay-selected session actions without live process control: reuse existing session, start new session, summarize and reset, transfer/handoff, archive, and request human gate. Confirm context-fill, reasoning-shift, project-scope, stale-heartbeat, review-gate, and permission-boundary reasons are typed/tested, and unique-worktree/assigned-queue/branch-permission invariants are preserved. Do not edit runtime code. If findings exist, route focused repairs to Build 2; otherwise mark passed and leave the next candidate.

Proof command:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_session_lifecycle.py -q`

Completion: commit only review-queue/provenance updates, push to `origin/main`, and leave a concrete Next Candidate.

## Next Candidate Task

Goal: review Build 3 FileMap registration for Relay proof payload contract docs after Build 3 marks it Ready for Codex Review.

Allowed review files: `meridian_core/filemap.py`, `docs/FileMap.md`, `tests/test_filemap.py`, `docs/live-build-3.md`, and `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` for provenance only.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Passed

Goal: review current-main Build 1 Relay proof payload serialization landing.

Status: passed by Codex Reviews A on 2026-06-01 16:26 -06:00. Current `origin/main` contains Relay proof payload serialization commit `7079ceb8`, and the required Relay executor proof passes.

Review result:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_relay_executor.py -q` passed with 145 tests.
- `git merge-base --is-ancestor 7079ceb8 HEAD` passed, proving the reviewed landing commit is in current main.
- `AegisGateEvidenceSummary.to_dict()` exposes stable keys for gate decision, severity, evidence ids, waiver presence, explanation, and Aegis fallback blockers.
- Serialized values remain deterministic and immutable-provider-neutral: scalar values plus tuple evidence ids and tuple fallback blockers, with repeated calls producing identical output.
- Scoped side-effect scan found no live Aegis/model/vendor/account/UI/process/branch/Polaris calls in `meridian_core/relay_executor.py` or `tests/test_relay_executor.py`.
- Local commits after `7079ceb8` do not modify the scoped Relay executor/test files, so the proof covers the reviewed Relay payload serialization state.

Finding: none. No CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW findings in the scoped review.

Completion: Build 1 Relay proof payload serialization is review-cleared. Build 2 Session Lifecycle routing-action implementation remains the next review candidate.

Worktree: `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\codex-reviews-a`.

Allowed review files: `meridian_core/relay_executor.py`, `tests/test_relay_executor.py`, `docs/live-build-1.md`, and `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` for provenance/routing only.

Task: verify that the Relay proof payload serialization hooks landed on current `origin/main` and pass proof. Confirm `AegisGateEvidenceSummary.to_dict()` exposes stable keys for gate decision, severity, evidence ids, waiver presence, explanation, and Aegis fallback blockers; preserves immutable/deterministic values; and does not add live Aegis/model/vendor/account/UI/process/branch/Polaris side effects. If clean, mark passed and promote the Build 2 Session Lifecycle review candidate. If not clean, route the smallest focused repair to Build 1.

Proof command:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_relay_executor.py -q`

Completion: commit only review-queue/provenance updates, push to `origin/main`, and leave a concrete Next Candidate.

## Next Candidate Task

Goal: review Build 2 Session Lifecycle routing-action implementation after Build 1 Relay proof payload review is closed.

Allowed review files: `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py`, `tests/test_session_lifecycle.py`, `docs/live-build-2.md`, and `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` for provenance/routing only.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Passed

Goal: review current-main Build 1 Relay summary serialization landing commit `ff6893c6`.

Status: passed by Codex Reviews A on 2026-06-01 16:20 -06:00. Current `origin/main` contains the reviewed Relay summary serialization commit and the required Relay executor proof passes.

Review result:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_relay_executor.py -q` passed with 140 tests.
- `git merge-base --is-ancestor ff6893c6 HEAD` passed, proving the reviewed landing commit is in current main.
- `AegisGateEvidenceSummary` is a frozen provider-neutral summary carrying gate decision, severity, evidence ids, waiver presence, explanation, and Relay blockers generated from Aegis evidence.
- `RelayExecutionSummary.aegis_gate_evidence_summary()` returns an empty summary without a decision record and extracts the Aegis decision/evidence fields from the decision record when present.
- Summary extraction filters Aegis-derived fallback blockers while preserving prior vendor/model blockers and Relay-side Aegis block/human-gate behavior.
- Side-effect scan found no live Aegis calls, model/vendor/account side effects, UI automation, process execution, branch movement, or Polaris dependency in the scoped Relay executor/test files.

Finding: none. No CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW findings in the scoped review.

Completion: Build 1 Relay summary serialization for Aegis gate evidence is review-cleared. Build 2 Session Lifecycle routing-action implementation remains the next review candidate.

Worktree: `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\codex-reviews-a`.

Allowed review files: `meridian_core/relay_executor.py`, `tests/test_relay_executor.py`, `docs/live-build-1.md`, and `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` for provenance/routing only.

Task: verify that the Build 1 Relay summary serialization for Aegis gate evidence is present in current `origin/main` and passes proof. Confirm `AegisGateEvidenceSummary` and `RelayExecutionSummary.aegis_gate_evidence_summary()` expose gate decision, severity, evidence ids, waiver presence, explanation, and Aegis-derived blockers without live Aegis calls or model/vendor/account side effects. Also confirm prior Relay vendor/model blocker and Aegis block/human-gate behavior remain intact. If clean, mark passed and promote the Build 2 Session Lifecycle review candidate. If not clean, route the smallest focused repair to Build 1.

Proof command:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_relay_executor.py -q`

Completion: commit only review-queue/provenance updates, push to `origin/main`, and leave a concrete Next Candidate.

## Next Candidate Task

Goal: review current-main Build 1 Relay proof payload serialization landing after it is committed to `origin/main`.

Allowed review files: `meridian_core/relay_executor.py`, `tests/test_relay_executor.py`, `docs/live-build-1.md`, and `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` for provenance/routing only.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Repair-Routed

Goal: review Build 1 Relay repair commits `c3d91214` and `69e9ff55`.

Worktree: `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\codex-reviews-a`.

Allowed review files: `meridian_core/relay_executor.py`, `tests/test_relay_executor.py`, `docs/live-build-1.md`, and `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` for provenance/routing only.

Task: verify whether Build 1 fully resolves the prior Relay decision-record vendor/model stop-condition finding and whether the new provider-neutral Aegis gate evidence fields are safe for downstream Relay use. Confirm missing vendor/model identity for Tier 2+ becomes explicit blockers, Aegis evidence fields are immutable/provider-neutral, no live vendor calls or account probing were added, and no UI/process/branch movement/Polaris dependency exists. If clean, mark Build 1 passed and promote the Build 2 Session Lifecycle review candidate. If not clean, route the smallest focused repair back to Build 1.

Proof command:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_relay_executor.py -q`

Completion: commit only review-queue/provenance updates, push to `origin/main`, and leave a concrete Next Candidate.

Status: repair routed by Codex Reviews A on 2026-06-01 16:04 -06:00. The commit objects exist locally, but neither reviewed commit is an ancestor of current `HEAD` / `origin/main`, so the required proof command executed the unrepaired Relay executor state.

Review result:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_relay_executor.py -q` passed with 121 tests in the current checkout.
- `git merge-base --is-ancestor 69e9ff55 HEAD` and `git merge-base --is-ancestor c3d91214 HEAD` both failed, proving the Ready marker commits are not in current `HEAD`.
- Current `meridian_core/relay_executor.py` still has `RelayDecisionRecord.vendor` and `model_id` comments/defaults from the pre-repair state and does not contain the new Aegis evidence fields from `69e9ff55`.
- No live vendor calls, account probing, UI automation, process execution, branch movement, or Polaris dependency was added by Reviews A.

Finding:

- HIGH: review provenance/branch visibility - Build 1 marked commits `c3d91214` and `69e9ff55` Ready for Codex Review, but current `origin/main` at review time is `84383cb4` and does not contain either commit. The required test proof therefore ran against unrepaired code and cannot prove the vendor/model blocker or Aegis evidence slices. Required repair: Build 1/coordinator must land the intended commits on `origin/main` through the approved branch path or requeue a current-main review target; then Reviews A can re-run the same Relay proof.

Completion: routed the focused provenance/visibility repair into `docs/live-build-1.md`. Runtime acceptance remains blocked until the reviewed commits are visible in current `origin/main` and the proof command exercises those changes.

## Next Candidate Task

Goal: review Build 2 Session Lifecycle routing-action implementation after Build 1 Relay review is closed.

Allowed review files: `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py`, `tests/test_session_lifecycle.py`, `docs/live-build-2.md`, and `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` for provenance/routing only.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Repair-Routed

Goal: review Build 1 Relay stop-condition repair commit `f0bb2bb6` and current `origin/main` state.

Worktree: `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\codex-reviews-a`.

Allowed review files: `meridian_core/relay_executor.py`, `tests/test_relay_executor.py`, `docs/live-build-1.md`, and `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` for provenance/routing only.

Task: verify whether the prior MEDIUM finding on `RelayDecisionRecord.vendor` and `model_id` is resolved. Confirm vendor/model identity is populated from safe metadata or represented as an explicit stop condition for Tier 2+ dispatch. Also confirm no live vendor calls, CLI execution, UI rendering, branch movement, account probing, or Polaris dependency was added. If clean, mark passed and promote the Build 2 Session Lifecycle review candidate. If not clean, route a focused repair to Build 1.

Proof command:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_relay_executor.py -q`

Completion: commit only review-queue/provenance updates, push to `origin/main`, and leave a concrete Next Candidate.

Status: repair routed by Codex Reviews A on 2026-06-01 15:55 -06:00. The repair populates `model_id` from lane preferred model and populates `vendor` from registry adapter metadata, but the unknown-vendor non-registry Tier 2+ path still is not represented as an explicit blocking stop condition.

Review result:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_relay_executor.py -q` passed with 121 tests.
- `execute_relay_plan_with_registry(..., include_decision_record=True)` now passes first adapter metadata into `_build_decision_record()`, and `RelayDecisionRecord.vendor` is populated from `adapter.metadata.provider_name` for registry execution.
- `_build_decision_record()` now populates `model_id` from the builder lane preferred model and returns `"unknown"` for Tier 2+ plans with no lanes.
- No live vendor calls, CLI execution, UI rendering, branch movement, account probing, network access, or Polaris dependency was added in the reviewed runtime/test diff.

Finding:

- MEDIUM: `meridian_core/relay_executor.py:213` and `meridian_core/relay_executor.py:218` - when adapter metadata is absent for Tier 2+ dispatch, `_build_decision_record()` sets `vendor = "unknown"` but does not add an explicit fallback blocker or otherwise force a stop condition. Manual proof using a clean Tier 2 audit with no fallback blockers returned `vendor='unknown'`, `model_id='primary-default'`, `fallback_allowed=True`, and `fallback_blockers=()`. Required repair: Build 1 must add provider-neutral coverage and implementation so missing safe vendor metadata for Tier 2+ becomes an explicit blocking fallback blocker before the decision record is considered explainable.

Completion: routed the focused repair into `docs/live-build-1.md`. Runtime acceptance remains blocked until Build 1 repairs the vendor-unknown stop-condition edge and Reviews A clears the repair.

## Next Candidate Task

Goal: review Build 2 Session Lifecycle routing-action implementation after Build 1 Relay review is closed.

Allowed review files: `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py`, `tests/test_session_lifecycle.py`, `docs/live-build-2.md`, and `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` for provenance/routing only.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Repair-Routed

Goal: review Build 1 Relay decision-record implementation commit `decfb84e` and its current `origin/main` state.

Allowed review files: `meridian_core/relay.py`, `meridian_core/relay_executor.py`, `tests/test_relay.py`, `tests/test_relay_executor.py`, and `docs/live-build-1.md` for repair routing only.

Task: verify the Relay decision-record implementation closes the previously routed HIGH/HIGH/MEDIUM findings: pre-dispatch route proof, route class/session action/fallback/context/proof fields, Tier 3 lane-independence evidence, and downstream-safe result/proof surface. Do not implement repairs. If findings remain, route a focused repair into `docs/live-build-1.md`; if clean, mark passed and promote the next review candidate.

Proof commands:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_relay.py tests/test_relay_executor.py -q`

Completion: commit only review-queue/provenance updates, push to `origin/main`, and leave a concrete Next Candidate.

Status: repair routed by Codex Reviews A on 2026-06-01 15:29 -06:00. The implementation adds the requested provider-neutral decision record shape, route audit defaults, fallback blockers, Tier 3 independence evidence, and downstream summary surface, but one model/vendor identity proof gap remains before the slice can be accepted.

Review result:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_relay.py tests/test_relay_executor.py -q` passed with 243 tests.
- `RelayRouteAudit` now carries route class, session action, trust, context health, route precedence, alternatives rejected, fallback blockers, proof requirements, and telemetry requirements.
- `RelayExecutionSummary` can carry an optional `RelayDecisionRecord`, and tests cover session action, route class, context health, trust state, proof requirements, fallback blockers, human gate, dual-lane requirement, prompt payload status, immutability, registry execution, and policy execution.
- The implementation remains provider-neutral and adds no live vendor calls, account automation, CLI execution, UI rendering, filesystem/process control, branch movement, or vendor secrets.

Finding:

- MEDIUM: `meridian_core/relay_executor.py:52` and `meridian_core/relay_executor.py:53` - `RelayDecisionRecord.vendor` and `model_id` are always `None`, and `_build_decision_record()` writes those `None` values at `meridian_core/relay_executor.py:223` and `meridian_core/relay_executor.py:224` even when `plan.lanes` has preferred model names and registry execution has adapter metadata with provider/model names. The Relay completeness audit says Tier 2+ must know exact model id and vendor or block; this repair exposes an explicit field but still lets nontrivial dispatch look explainable while selected model/vendor identity remains unknown. Required repair: Build 1 must add provider-neutral coverage so model/vendor identity is populated from safe available lane/adapter metadata or represented as a blocking/unknown stop condition before Tier 2+ dispatch is considered explainable.

Completion: routed the focused repair into the existing Build 1 stop-condition Active Task in `docs/live-build-1.md`. Runtime acceptance remains blocked until that Build 1 slice is completed and review-cleared.

## Next Candidate Task

Goal: review Build 2 Session Lifecycle routing-action implementation after it is marked Ready for Codex Review.

Allowed review files: `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py`, `tests/test_session_lifecycle.py`, and `docs/live-build-2.md` for provenance/routing only.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Repair-Routed

Goal: review the current Relay/account/session routing design before the next runtime slice is accepted.

Worktree: `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\codex-reviews-a`.

Allowed review files: `docs/relay-heartbeat-model-routing-logic.md`, `docs/relay-completeness-audit.md`, `meridian_core/relay_executor.py`, `tests/test_relay_executor.py`, and `docs/live-build-1.md` for repair routing only.

Task: review whether the current Relay runtime and tests can support the new V2 requirements: account/session routes before API, direct provider before aggregator, Tier 3 dual independent model lanes, explicit session-action decisions, no silent fallback, model/vendor/risk proof, and human-gated stop conditions. Do not implement repairs. If findings exist, route a focused repair into `docs/live-build-1.md`; otherwise mark this review passed and leave the next review candidate.

Proof command:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_relay_executor.py -q`

Completion: commit only review-queue/provenance updates, push to `origin/main`, and leave a concrete Next Candidate.

Status: repair routed by Codex Reviews A on 2026-06-01 15:20 -06:00. The current Relay executor remains a pure payload-only boundary and its targeted tests pass, but it cannot yet support the V2 routing requirements from the Relay completeness audit without an additional Build 1 decision-record slice.

Review result:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_relay_executor.py -q` passed with 80 tests.
- `meridian_core/relay_executor.py` preserves the no-live-vendor boundary: no direct API calls, account automation, filesystem/process control, branch movement, UI rendering, or vendor-specific secrets were added.
- `docs/relay-heartbeat-model-routing-logic.md` and `docs/relay-completeness-audit.md` require route class, session action, account/session-first precedence, direct-vs-aggregator posture, Tier 3 independent lanes, no silent fallback, model/vendor/risk proof, and user-visible stop conditions.
- `docs/live-build-1.md` already has a matching Active Now repair task: "implement Relay decision-record coverage from the completeness audit."

Findings:

- HIGH: `meridian_core/relay_executor.py:183` - registry-backed dispatch resolves and calls adapters using only lane role/preferred-model resolution, then records adapter metadata after the call. It has no pre-dispatch decision record for `route_class`, account/session-vs-CLI-vs-direct-API-vs-aggregator route, session action, fallback posture, context health, or proof references, so Relay cannot prove account/session routes were considered before API routes or that fallback was not silent. Required repair: Build 1 must add provider-neutral Relay decision-record support or equivalent test coverage that exposes those fields before dispatch and blocks/records unknown route class, unknown session action, and silent fallback for nontrivial risk.
- HIGH: `meridian_core/relay_executor.py:202` - Tier 3+ dispatch has no lane-independence gate. The executor pre-resolves adapters per lane but does not verify distinct vendor/model-family/route trust, and tests currently only assert call counts (`tests/test_relay_executor.py:82`) or independent adapter objects for lower-level registry mechanics (`tests/test_relay_executor.py:463`). Required repair: Build 1 must add Tier 3 dual-independent-lane decision evidence and tests that reject or visibly block/waive non-independent lanes before model calls.
- MEDIUM: `meridian_core/relay_executor.py:35` - `RelayExecutionResult` only carries role, preferred model, output, optional payload snapshot, and optional adapter metadata. It does not carry the required Relay decision record fields for model/vendor/risk proof, stop conditions, fallback blockers, or observability. Required repair: Build 1 must extend the provider-neutral result/proof surface or companion record so downstream Prime/Bifrost can explain the route without leaking prompt payloads.

Completion: focused repair is routed to Build 1 by the existing Active Now task in `docs/live-build-1.md`; no implementation was changed by Reviews A. Runtime acceptance remains blocked until that Build 1 slice is completed and review-cleared.

## Next Candidate Task

Goal: review Build 2 Session Lifecycle routing-action implementation after it is marked Ready for Codex Review.

Allowed review files: `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py`, `tests/test_session_lifecycle.py`, and `docs/live-build-2.md` for provenance/routing only.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Passed

Goal: verify Build 1 repair commit `19f4516` closes the PrimeCockpitSnapshot immutability finding.

Status: passed by Codex Reviews A on 2026-05-31 22:43 -06:00. The repair normalizes mutable lane/event sequence inputs to tuples during snapshot construction and adds regression coverage proving source-list mutation no longer changes the snapshot.

Allowed review files: `meridian_core/cockpit_state.py`, `tests/test_cockpit_state.py`, `docs/live-build-1.md` for provenance only.

Proof commands:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_cockpit_state.py -q`
- `python -m pytest tests/test_model_adapter.py tests/test_relay_executor.py -q`

Completion: if clean, commit and push only `docs/live-codex-reviews.md`; if findings remain, route a focused repair into `docs/live-build-1.md`.

Review result:

- `PrimeCockpitSnapshot.__post_init__()` converts non-tuple `lanes` and `progress_events` inputs to tuples using `object.__setattr__()` within the frozen dataclass.
- Regression tests cover list-to-tuple conversion for both fields and verify mutating the original source lists after construction does not change the stored snapshot contents.
- The repair preserves the pure data-model boundary: no filesystem, CLI, UI, network, model, or live queue side effects were added.

Proof:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_cockpit_state.py -q` passed with 29 tests.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_model_adapter.py tests/test_relay_executor.py -q` passed with 86 tests.

Completion: committed and pushed `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` only. No repair routed.

## Next Candidate Task

Goal: review Build 2 Session Lifecycle runtime implementation commit `910e652` and queue provenance `a80d439` / `85f4775`.

Allowed review files: `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py`, `tests/test_session_lifecycle.py`, and `docs/live-build-2.md` for provenance only.

Proof command: `python -m pytest tests/test_session_lifecycle.py -q`

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Repair-Routed

Goal: review Build 2 Session Lifecycle implementation checklist commit `0296525`.

Status: repair routed by Codex Reviews A on 2026-05-31 22:17 -06:00. The checklist cannot be accepted because the declared artifact is missing from current `HEAD`, and commit `0296525` only updates queue provenance.

Scope:

- Build 2 commit `0296525` - marks the checklist complete and records queue provenance.
- Checklist artifact: `docs/session-lifecycle-implementation-checklist.md`.

Allowed review files:

- `docs/session-lifecycle-implementation-checklist.md`
- `docs/session-lifecycle-v2-contract.md` for source-contract comparison only.
- `docs/live-build-2.md` for provenance only.

Proof commands:

- Docs-only review; no tests required unless the review changes runtime or test files.

Review expectations:

- Verify the checklist faithfully translates the reviewed Session Lifecycle contract into code-ready enums, dataclasses, fields, legality helpers, executability helpers, proof expectations, tests, and out-of-scope boundaries.
- Verify it preserves the unique-worktree, queue-routing, branch-permission, human-gate, no-live-process-control, no-destructive-command, no-vendor-account, and no-UI-automation boundaries.
- Verify Build 2 has a valid follow-on runtime task and that any actionable checklist finding is routed back to Build 2 before the runtime slice is accepted.

Completion: if clean, commit and push only `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` with the review result. If findings exist, route a focused repair into `docs/live-build-2.md` before normal work continues.

Review result:

- `docs/session-lifecycle-v2-contract.md` exists and defines the source contract.
- `docs/session-lifecycle-implementation-checklist.md` is absent from current `HEAD`.
- `git show --stat 0296525` shows only `docs/live-build-2.md` changed, despite the queue entry claiming the checklist file was created.
- Earlier history contains a checklist artifact at `78d9bdd`, but commit `594e0d9` deletes it; the reviewed state therefore cannot support the follow-on runtime task.

Proof:

- Docs-only review; no tests required.
- `Get-Content docs/session-lifecycle-implementation-checklist.md` failed because the file does not exist.
- `git show --stat --oneline 0296525` showed one changed file: `docs/live-build-2.md`.

Finding:

- MEDIUM: the checklist Ready marker is stale/incomplete because the required `docs/session-lifecycle-implementation-checklist.md` artifact is missing from `HEAD`.

Completion: routed focused repair to Build 2 in `docs/live-build-2.md`; runtime implementation remains blocked until the checklist artifact is restored and review-cleared.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Repair-Routed

Goal: review the Build 1 Model Harness and cockpit-state runtime cadence window.

Status: repair routed by Codex Reviews A on 2026-05-31 22:09 -06:00. Model adapter, registry dispatch, HTTP transport final repaired state, Relay/Aegis proof gating, and targeted tests passed. One MEDIUM cockpit-state immutability finding was routed to Build 1.

Scope:

- Build 1 commits `653488b`, `0560eb4`, `869faa4`, repair commit `f353c8d`, and `f56af55`.

Allowed review files:

- `meridian_core/model_adapter.py`
- `meridian_core/relay_executor.py`
- `tests/test_model_adapter.py`
- `tests/test_relay_executor.py`
- `meridian_core/cockpit_state.py`
- `tests/test_cockpit_state.py`
- `docs/live-build-1.md` for provenance and repair routing only.

Proof:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_model_adapter.py tests/test_relay_executor.py -q` passed with 77 tests.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_cockpit_state.py -q` passed with 25 tests.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_cognition_policy.py tests/test_aegis.py tests/test_relay_executor.py -q` passed with 157 tests.
- Edge proof showed `PrimeCockpitSnapshot(..., lanes=list, progress_events=list)` stores mutable lists and changes when the source list is mutated after construction.

Finding:

- MEDIUM: `PrimeCockpitSnapshot` is a frozen dataclass and documents an immutable snapshot, but direct construction accepts mutable lists for `lanes` and `progress_events`; those lists remain externally mutable after construction.

Completion: routed focused repair to Build 1 in `docs/live-build-1.md`. Commit and push `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` and `docs/live-build-1.md` only.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Superseded

Goal: verify the Build 2 PrimeNextAction human-gate repair.

Status: superseded by Reviews C. Codex Reviews C passed repair commit `39c9ac8` on 2026-05-31 15:55 -06:00 with `python -m pytest tests/test_prime_autonomy.py -q` and `python -m pytest tests/test_prime_autonomy.py tests/test_filemap.py -q`. Reviews A should not re-run this stale duplicate task.

Scope:

- Original finding: Codex Reviews A Round 6 MEDIUM finding against Build 2 commit `40def3d`; `PrimeNextAction.is_executable()` ignored `human_gate_required`.
- Repair commits: `594e0d9` changes runtime/test behavior; `631e764` merges the repair into main; `e738e5f` records the Build 2 queue provenance.
- Inspect swept-in commit scope carefully: `594e0d9` also carried unrelated staged files from the shared main worktree. Review only the PrimeNextAction repair behavior for pass/fail, and separately flag any harmful unrelated scope drift if found.

Allowed review files:

- `meridian_core/prime_autonomy.py`
- `tests/test_prime_autonomy.py`
- `docs/live-build-2.md` for repair provenance only.
- Supporting comparison only: original review finding text in `docs/live-codex-reviews.md`.

Proof commands:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_prime_autonomy.py -q`
- Reference check that `PrimeNextAction.is_executable()` returns false when `human_gate_required=True`.
- Diff review of `594e0d9` against the original finding to confirm the repair did not add live execution, UI approval workflows, package exports, or model/provider side effects.

Review expectations:

- Verify human-gated Prime actions are not executable before a later approval model exists.
- Verify blocker semantics still make blocked actions non-executable.
- Verify safe fallback actions without blockers or human gates remain executable.
- Verify tests cover the human-gate executable predicate explicitly.
- If clean, update the Build 2 checkpoint to passed and clear the routed MEDIUM finding. If findings remain, route a focused repair back to Build 2 before normal Session Lifecycle work proceeds.

Completion: commit and push only `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` unless routing a repair into `docs/live-build-2.md`.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Passed

Goal: review Build 1 Prime project-state next-action selector commit `57aad9a`.

Status: passed by Codex Reviews A on 2026-05-31 21:55 -06:00. The selector is deterministic, preserves human-gate executability semantics, and adds no model calls, filesystem access, network access, live queue mutation, package export change, or approval workflow.

Scope:

- Build 1 commit `57aad9a` - extends `meridian_core/prime_autonomy.py` and `tests/test_prime_autonomy.py` with deterministic project-state next-action selection.
- Queue provenance commit `a2b8cd0` - records the completion marker in `docs/live-build-1.md`.

Allowed review files:

- `meridian_core/prime_autonomy.py`
- `tests/test_prime_autonomy.py`
- `docs/live-build-1.md` for provenance only.

Proof commands:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_prime_autonomy.py -q`

Review expectations:

- Verify deterministic priority ordering, review-gate blocking, human-gate behavior, safe fallback on missing state, and no regression to existing executability semantics.
- Verify no model calls, filesystem access, network access, live queue mutation, package export change, or approval workflow was added.
- If clean, mark Build 1 `57aad9a` passed and leave the lane on its current Model Harness metadata Active Task. If findings exist, route a focused repair back to Build 1.

Review result:

- `ProjectStateSignal` is a frozen plain-data snapshot and the selector consumes it without I/O, model calls, queue mutation, or approval workflow side effects.
- Priority order is deterministic: missing state, human gate, blockers, high risk, review gate, no active task, active task.
- Human-gated and high-risk actions are non-executable because `PrimeNextAction.is_executable()` still requires no blockers and no pending human gate.
- Existing constructor/helper behavior remains covered by regression tests.

Proof:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_prime_autonomy.py -q` passed with 55 tests.

Completion: committed and pushed `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` plus `docs/v2-progress-tracker.md` tracker implication. No repair routed.

No active task. Continue polling for new Ready-for-Codex-Review markers, cadence triggers, or repair-verification needs.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Passed

Goal: review and clear Build 1 Prime queue runway policy repair commit `b13f10f`.

Status: passed by Codex Reviews A on 2026-05-31 15:34 -06:00. The policy repair removes the old read-check-as-work posture, requires Prime to prepare runway ahead of idle, preserves cadence/review/human/provider gates, and keeps the hard worktree, queue-routing, branch-permission, stale-task, and three-task-changing-commit invariants intact.

Scope:

- Build 1 commit `b13f10f` - hardens `docs/prime-queue-runway-policy.md` and marks the task complete in `docs/live-build-1.md`.
- Queue provenance commit `b5724ba` - records the completion hash in `docs/live-build-1.md`.

Allowed review files:

- `docs/prime-queue-runway-policy.md`
- `docs/live-build-1.md` for provenance only.

Proof commands:

- Docs-only review; no tests required.

Review expectations:

- Verify the policy no longer says read-check-only commits are valid progress or normal work.
- Verify the policy requires Prime to assign runway ahead of idle and explicitly record cadence/review/human/provider gates.
- Verify the policy preserves hard invariants: unique worktrees, assigned queue routing, branch movement permission, stale top-task closure, and three task-changing commit review cadence.
- Verify Build 1 has a valid next Active Task after the completed policy repair so the lane is not idle.
- If clean, record proof and clear the policy repair. If findings exist, route a focused repair back to Build 1.

Review result:

- Docs-only review; no tests required.
- `docs/prime-queue-runway-policy.md` says read-check-only commits are not work and should not spam `main`.
- The policy requires an executable Active Task, a staged Next Candidate Task, and explicit gate state for cadence, review, human, provider/model, worktree, branch-permission, or repair blocks.
- The policy preserves unique worktrees, assigned queue routing, branch movement permission, stale top-task closure, and the three task-changing commit Codex review cadence.
- `docs/live-build-1.md` records commit `b13f10f`, and the first following Build 1 Active Task is the Echo/Atlas handoff review note.

Completion: committed and pushed `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` only. No repair routed.

No active task. Continue polling for new Ready-for-Codex-Review markers, cadence triggers, or repair-verification needs.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Passed

Goal: review and clear Build 1 FileMap registration commit `9fa9cdf`.

Status: passed by Codex Reviews A on 2026-05-31 15:24 -06:00. The FileMap registration adds the V2 prompt payload meter and Prime autonomy runtime/test files to the runtime map, required-path coverage, and human-readable `docs/FileMap.md` mirror without scope drift. After rebasing on latest `origin/main`, the Build 1 queue marker points to commit `9fa9cdf`.

Scope:

- Coordinator commit `9fa9cdf` - registers V2 prompt payload and Prime autonomy modules/tests in FileMap.
- Queue provenance: `docs/live-build-1.md` completion marker for the FileMap registration slice.

Allowed review files:

- `meridian_core/filemap.py`
- `tests/test_filemap.py`
- `docs/FileMap.md`
- `docs/live-build-1.md` for provenance only.

Proof commands:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py -q`

Review expectations:

- Verify `meridian_core/prompt_payload_meter.py` and `tests/test_prompt_payload_meter.py` are discoverable in `make_default_map()` and `_REQUIRED_PATHS`.
- Verify `meridian_core/prime_autonomy.py` and `tests/test_prime_autonomy.py` are discoverable in `make_default_map()` and `_REQUIRED_PATHS`.
- Verify the new FileMap area/name does not conflict with existing entries and the docs mirror the runtime map.
- Verify the queue marker correctly points to commit `9fa9cdf` and does not leave Build 1 with a stale executable top task.
- If clean, record proof and clear the FileMap registration. If findings exist, route a focused repair back to Build 1.

Review result:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py -q` passed with 46 tests.
- `make_default_map()` includes `meridian_core/prompt_payload_meter.py`, `tests/test_prompt_payload_meter.py`, `meridian_core/prime_autonomy.py`, and `tests/test_prime_autonomy.py`.
- `_REQUIRED_PATHS` includes all four paths.
- `docs/FileMap.md` mirrors the same four entries with the expected Relay prompt metrics and Prime Autonomy areas.
- `docs/live-build-1.md` marks the FileMap task completed, ready for Codex review, and points to commit `9fa9cdf`.

Completion: committed and pushed `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` only. No repair routed.

No active task. Continue polling for new Ready-for-Codex-Review markers, cadence triggers, or repair-verification needs.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Passed

Goal: review and clear or repair the V2 Prime Session Lifecycle restart/resteer runtime slice.

Status: passed by Codex Reviews A on 2026-05-31 15:12 -06:00. The current restart/resteer runtime state closes the empty-review-queue runway risk, preserves wrong-queue role distinctions, escalates shared/main worktree and branch movement risks, and remains pure with no live side effects. V2 tracker reconciliation can treat the Session Lifecycle restart/resteer evaluator as review-cleared.

Scope:

- Runtime commit `8b4c8ac` - `meridian_core/restart_resteer.py`, `tests/test_restart_resteer.py`.
- Contract commit `27e1b1f` - `docs/prime-restart-resteer-contract.md`.

Proof commands:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_restart_resteer.py -q`
- `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py tests/test_restart_resteer.py -q`

Review expectations:

- Verify empty build queues route to resteer without treating empty review queues as build-runway failures.
- Verify wrong-queue findings distinguish build lanes reading review queues and review lanes reading build queues.
- Verify shared/main worktree findings are blocking and preserve the Prime Directive that every worker/review session uses a unique worktree.
- Verify branch movement, quota blocks, launch/popup failures, proof blocks, and stale/polling findings produce deterministic directives without performing live side effects.
- Verify the module is pure: no subprocess, filesystem mutation, network calls, branch movement, or UI automation.
- Verify the contract remains aligned with the runtime object names and safety posture.
- If clean, record proof and mark the V2 tracker implication as review-cleared.
- If findings exist, route a focused repair back to the owning build lane with allowed files and tests.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Passed

Goal: verify Build 1 repair commit `8e8c87b` closes the V2 runtime/code MEDIUM findings.

Status: passed by Codex Reviews A on 2026-05-31 14:57 -06:00. Build 1 repair commit `8e8c87b` closes the prompt payload meter zero/invalid budget finding and Echo naive timestamp finding; V2 tracker reconciliation can treat Echo and prompt payload meter as review-cleared for this repair.

Review expectations:

- Verify zero and negative budgets cannot crash `budget_percent` or `status`.
- Verify Echo queries cannot crash on naive `created_at` values and preserve deterministic ordering/filtering.
- If clean, clear the Build 1 repair and update the V2 tracker implication for Echo and prompt payload meter review state.

## Completed / Stale Prior Scope

## Archived Prior Review Scope - Do Not Execute

Round 7 complete (2026-05-31 13:30 -06:00).

- Scope: coordinator commit `39c9ac8` covering Prime human-gate repair and Bifrost source-first cockpit runway docs.
- Result: repair routed.
- Findings: no CRITICAL/HIGH findings. Prime human-gate repair passed. One MEDIUM queue/docs finding: Build 5 now has a JARVIS-source active task at the top, but a lower stale `## Active Task` still assigns the old `docs/bifrost-v2-extensions-contract.md`; `docs/v2-detailed-build-plan.md` also still lists that stale path while `docs/v2-progress-tracker.md` uses `docs/bifrost-v2-cockpit-extensions.md`.
- Repair routing: Build 5 repair Active Task written to `docs/live-build-5.md`.
- Proofs: `tests/test_prime_autonomy.py tests/test_bifrost_cockpit.py tests/test_bifrost_preview.py` 137 passed; `tests/test_filemap.py tests/test_prompt_metrics.py` 94 passed; path/reference inspection found the stale Build 5 duplicate Active Task and stale V2 plan contract path.

- Verify the Prime human-gate repair: `PrimeNextAction.is_executable()` must return false when `human_gate_required=True`.
- Verify the Bifrost runway now requires a source-first JARVIS/HUD UI adoption path rather than a generic from-scratch dashboard.
- Review coordinator commit `f1a1b7c`:
  - `.gitignore`
  - `bifrost/cockpit.py`
  - `bifrost/static/cockpit.css`
  - `tests/test_bifrost_cockpit.py`
  - `docs/bifrost-v2-cockpit-extensions.md`
  - `docs/jarvis-ui-source-assessment.md`
  - `docs/live-build-2.md`
  - `docs/v2-detailed-build-plan.md`
  - `docs/v2-progress-tracker.md`
- Verify the cockpit render now visibly moves toward the parsed JARVIS/HUD reference: numbered HUD panes, central Prime HUD, queue runway, proof console, provider/prompt payload surface, visible Voice I/O, and real nav buttons.
- Verify V2 tracker totals still add up after the new Bifrost Voice I/O item.
- Then continue any still-unreviewed prior scope below as time allows:
- Review recent Meridian commits since the last trusted Codex review checkpoint, prioritizing runtime/API/test slices and V2 scope changes:
  - `e874d3e` Add visible prompt payload meter to V2 scope
  - `8430040` Add Balance button to Meridian V2 scope
  - `b158550` Add DeepSeek as primary Meridian provider
  - `8b4c8ac` Add Prime restart resteer evaluator
  - `27e1b1f` Document Prime restart and resteer contract
  - `e5f3673` Harden cockpit Electron proof surface
  - `7d82b79` Build Bifrost cockpit visual shell
- Also inspect `docs/live-build-1.md` and `docs/live-build-2.md` for any newer `Ready for Codex Review` markers from the restarted Haiku Build 1/2 lanes.

Rules:

- Findings first, severity ordered: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW.
- For code/runtime commits, inspect the diff and run targeted tests when tests exist.
- For docs/scope commits, verify referenced files exist and check for contradictions or stale claims.
- Do not implement product code.
- If a repair is needed, route a repair Active Task back to the original build lane queue.
- Record scope, proofs, findings, and checkpoint updates in this file.
- Commit and push only `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` unless you explicitly route a repair into a build queue.

Expected first proof commands:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_prime_autonomy.py tests/test_bifrost_cockpit.py tests/test_bifrost_preview.py -q`
- `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py tests/test_prompt_metrics.py -q`
- Add any narrower tests required by the reviewed diff.

## Q Polling Source of Truth

When the Polaris `Q` button is enabled for **Codex Reviews A**, the session must read this file first and treat this file as its executable queue. Build queue files are review inputs only: inspect them for `Ready for Codex Review` markers, cadence triggers, commit hashes, and repair status, but do not execute build-lane Active Tasks from a review session.

This queue is also a Prime prototype. The checkpoint ledger, review scope declaration, repair routing, and lane-clearing logic are not throwaway process. They are intended to become part of Meridian's orchestration harness: Prime should eventually own this loop natively instead of relying on humans to paste work between sessions.

When idle, check this file every 30 seconds. Also inspect `docs/live-build-1.md` through `docs/live-build-5.md` for slices marked `Ready for Codex Review`, stale active tasks, or repair completions.

Codex Reviews A owns runtime, package API, tests, behavior, and code-level regression reviews unless Prime assigns a different scope.

Codex Reviews B (`docs/live-codex-reviews-2.md`) owns docs, architecture, FileMap, Bifrost, and strategic consistency reviews unless Prime assigns a different scope.

This split is deliberate: Meridian must be able to dynamically spawn review sessions when the review queue becomes the bottleneck. Every review session must declare scope and checkpoints before it starts so parallel review capacity does not create duplicate or conflicting findings.

## Rules

- Treat this workflow as future Prime behavior: review state, checkpoints, scope, and repair routing are orchestration-harness responsibilities.
- Always pull latest `origin/main` before reviewing.
- Do not implement product code.
- Do not edit runtime files, package exports, tests, or architecture docs except when an Active Task explicitly says this review lane may update queue/review records.
- Coordinate scope with `docs/live-codex-reviews-2.md` before reviewing docs/architecture slices.
- Own review coordination files and live queue routing only.
- Review completed build slices by commit hash.
- Inspect the diff, compare it to the lane's allowed files and task text, and run targeted tests when code changed.
- Record proofs for every review pass. A pass without proof is not a clearance; it is only an opinion.
- For docs-only slices, inspect for stale claims, contradictions, missing references, and scope drift.
- Record each review result in this file.
- If there are no actionable findings, mark the source build lane clear and eligible for new work.
- If there are actionable findings, write a repair Active Task back into the original build lane's queue file. The original builder repairs its own slice.
- CRITICAL and HIGH findings block the lane until repaired.
- MEDIUM findings should usually be repaired before more work unless the finding is intentionally deferred by Codex.
- LOW findings may be deferred, but must be recorded.
- After every three task-changing commits from any one build lane, perform a cadence review before that lane receives more normal build work.
- A single `Ready for Codex Review` marker is a review signal, not automatically a build stop. Normal build work may continue until the lane reaches three task-changing commits since its last checkpoint, unless a reviewer has routed a repair, marked the lane blocked, or Prime explicitly escalates the slice as high risk.
- Reviews should catch up in parallel while builders keep moving. Prime's default throughput target is three build slices per active lane per review cadence.
- Update Obsidian build notes in `G:\My Drive\Aesop Academy\Obsidian\Meridian_Build` when a review finds or clears important issues.

## Review Inputs

Poll these files:

- `docs/live-build-1.md`
- `docs/live-build-2.md`
- `docs/live-build-3.md`
- `docs/live-build-4.md`
- `docs/live-build-5.md`

Look for:

- `Ready for Codex Review`
- completed commits without a review result
- three-commit cadence triggers
- CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW findings
- stale Active Task sections that were already completed
- repair tasks waiting for verification

## Checkpoint Ledger

This is the review lane's cursor. Update it after every review pass so the next poll knows exactly what has and has not been cleared.

| Build lane | Last reviewed commit | Last reviewed task | Review status | Pending finding / repair | Next action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Build 1 | 19f4516 | PrimeCockpitSnapshot immutability repair | passed | none | await next Ready for Codex Review marker |
| Build 2 | 0296525 | Session Lifecycle implementation checklist marker | repair routed | MEDIUM: `docs/session-lifecycle-implementation-checklist.md` is missing from `HEAD`, and `0296525` only updates queue provenance despite claiming the artifact was created | Build 2 repair task written in `docs/live-build-2.md` |
| Build 3 | ef934b1 | FileMap refresh + FileMap Relay maturity repair (7ec16ac..ef934b1) | passed | observational: next FileMap refresh should add `meridian_core/relay_dispatch.py` (introduced by Build 1 fd35a81 after this commit) | await next Ready for Codex Review marker |
| Build 4 | 736b6af | architecture consistency pass — Q button reference + cadence closure | passed | none | await next Ready for Codex Review marker |
| Build 5 | d1d32af | Bifrost cockpit queue status brief + V0 cockpit layout brief (818bb31..d1d32af) | passed | none — Build 5 cadence pause cleared by this review | await next Ready for Codex Review marker |

Checkpoint rules:

- `Last reviewed commit` must be an actual commit hash, not "latest".
- `Review status` must be one of: `pending review`, `passed`, `repair routed`, `repair pending verification`, `blocked`, `deferred`.
- When a repair is routed, keep the original commit in `Last reviewed commit` and put the repair requirement in `Pending finding / repair`.
- When the repair lands and passes verification, update `Last reviewed commit` to the repair commit and set `Review status` to `passed`.
- Do not advance a lane's checkpoint just because a newer commit exists. Advance only after review.
- If multiple commits land before the next review, review the full range from the checkpoint to the newest completed commit and record the range in `Last reviewed task`.
- Do not use a pending review alone as a reason to stop a builder lane before the three-commit cadence threshold. Stop the lane only for cadence, routed repair, explicit block, or high-risk Prime escalation.

## Review Round Scope

Before starting each review round, write the scope here. This prevents the review lane from silently reviewing a different set of files than the build lane intended.

Tests to run: docs-only review; no tests required unless runtime/test files change
Out of scope: executing Build 2 runtime Active Task; implementing `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py`; Build 3/4/5 markers
Reason: active Reviews A queue task for Build 2 Session Lifecycle implementation checklist
```

Scope rules:

- Declare scope before reading deeply or writing findings.
- If scope changes mid-review, add a new scope entry instead of silently broadening it.
- Review only files changed by the target commit/range unless the scope explicitly names supporting files needed for correctness.
- If the changed files include areas owned by another active lane, record that as a scope concern before reviewing.
- For repair verification, scope is the repair commit plus the original finding.
- For cadence review, scope is the lane's commits since the last passed checkpoint.

YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Reviewed Build <n> commit <hash>; result: pass/finding/blocked; tests: <summary>; notes: <short note>

2026-05-30 15:30 CDT - Reviewed Build 1 commit 6af04d4; result: pass; tests: pytest tests/test_relay_packet.py 18/18 passed (covered jointly with fd35a81); notes: assemble_relay_packet() helper is pure-domain glue; reads route.prompt_budget; defaults source_lineage to direct_input; validates via build_prompt_packet(); thorough test coverage.
2026-05-30 15:30 CDT - Reviewed Build 1 commit fd35a81; result: pass; tests: pytest tests/test_relay_dispatch.py 23/23 passed; notes: RelayDispatchPlan + RelayDispatchLane frozen dataclasses; build_relay_dispatch_plan() maps route+packet to per-lane payloads using packet.model_payload() only; Tier 0 produces empty lanes; lane order preserved; payload exactly equals model_payload() with no metadata leakage.
2026-05-30 15:30 CDT - Reviewed Build 2 commit 4be1117; result: pass; tests: docs-only (no tests required); notes: prompt-packet-package-api-note.md cleanly rewritten as post-export record; correct PromptPacketError → PromptPacketValidationError; references commits 0ce0cf9, f2f69ff, e73b840 (all present in history).
2026-05-30 15:30 CDT - Reviewed Build 2 commit bf15569; result: pass; tests: docs-only (no tests required); notes: removed stale is_valid/validation_errors claim; replaced with accurate exception-based contract description; verified by grep — no is_valid/validation_errors symbols exist in meridian_core/prompt_packet.py.
2026-05-30 15:30 CDT - Reviewed Build 3 commit 7ec16ac; result: pass; tests: covered jointly with ef934b1; notes: 6-line FileMap.md additions for tokens.py, review-console contract, relay-packet plan, queue hygiene, bifrost brief, live-build-5 — narrow and scope-appropriate.
2026-05-30 15:30 CDT - Reviewed Build 3 commit ef934b1; result: pass; tests: pytest tests/test_filemap.py 46/46 passed; notes: FileMap repair is comprehensive — relay.py now correctly states "carries CouncilPlan and PromptBudgetPlan for every dispatch"; prompt_budget.py reclassified from "no integration yet" to integrated; relay_packet.py added with related_tests=[tests/test_relay_packet.py]; bifrost-cockpit-queue-status-brief.md added; FileArea.BIFROST enum added; required-path coverage updated.
2026-05-30 15:30 CDT - Reviewed Build 4 commit 736b6af; result: pass; tests: docs-only (no tests required); notes: narrow consistency pass — Q button note in meridian-capabilities-architecture-map.md now correctly cross-references docs/bifrost-session-queue-activation-brief.md (verified present); Codex review cadence closed in live-build-4.md log.
2026-05-30 15:30 CDT - Reviewed Build 5 commit 818bb31; result: pass; tests: docs-only (no tests required); notes: bifrost-cockpit-queue-status-brief.md is a coherent 13-section strategic brief; cross-references docs/cockpit-ui-architecture.md and docs/polaris-ui-lessons-for-meridian.md (both verified present); canonical lane status set + Beacon contract + Polaris lessons clearly documented.
2026-05-30 15:30 CDT - Reviewed Build 5 commit d1d32af; result: pass; tests: docs-only (no tests required); notes: bifrost-v0-cockpit-layout-brief.md is a coherent 14-section V0 layout brief; cross-references both companion briefs (verified present); ASCII layout sketch + scaling rules + "leave out" list are scope-appropriate; cadence pause cleared.
2026-05-31 16:30 CDT - Reviewed Build 1 commit d2820d2; result: pass; tests: pytest tests/test_lane_state.py 37/37 passed; notes: WorkerLaneState frozen dataclass + LaneStatus (9 states) + LaneReviewState (5 states); transition helpers (mark_running/mark_blocked/mark_ready_for_review/mark_review_passed) use dataclasses.replace and return new instances; pure domain — no I/O, no datetime parsing; mark_review_passed correctly clears active_task to "" using raw literal not the if-pattern.
2026-05-31 16:30 CDT - Reviewed Build 2 commit 46e4eb3; result: pass; tests: docs-only (no tests required); notes: relay-package-api-policy-note.md correctly records assemble_relay_packet, RelayDispatchLane, RelayDispatchPlan, build_relay_dispatch_plan, count_tokens as intentional internals — verified by grep that none appear in meridian_core/__init__.py; package-api-surface-note.md updated with cross-reference and matching "What Stays Internal" entry; three-condition export gate (external need / stable shape / no undocumented dependencies) is reasonable and explicit; build_prompt_packet() correctly noted as already exported.
2026-05-31 12:58 -06:00 - Reviewed Round 4 coordinator override commits 7d82b79, e5f3673, 27e1b1f, 8b4c8ac, b158550, 8430040, e874d3e; result: finding/repair-routed; tests: `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py tests/test_prompt_metrics.py -q` 94 passed; `python -m pytest tests/test_restart_resteer.py tests/test_bifrost_cockpit.py tests/test_bifrost_preview.py -q` 124 passed; `npm run proof:cockpit` 108 passed + 0 vulnerabilities; notes: Bifrost shell/proof surface and V2 scope docs cleared; restart/resteer evaluator has one committed MEDIUM lane-role bug and one LOW contract/API signature mismatch; repair routed to Build 1.
2026-05-31 13:04 -06:00 - Reviewed Build 1 repair commit 40def3d; result: pass with LOW process note; tests: `python -m pytest tests/test_restart_resteer.py -q` 16 passed; `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py tests/test_restart_resteer.py -q` 62 passed; notes: repair closes Round 4 findings by gating `EMPTY_QUEUE` to `LaneRole.BUILD`, adding idle-review-lane regression coverage, and updating contract signature to `choose_recovery_action(frame, findings)`; Prime Autonomy files in the same commit were out of Round 5 scope and not reviewed here.
2026-05-31 13:06 -06:00 - Reviewed Build 2 commit 40def3d; result: finding/repair-routed; tests: `python -m pytest tests/test_prime_autonomy.py -q` 30 passed; `python -m pytest tests/test_prime_autonomy.py tests/test_filemap.py -q` 76 passed; notes: PrimeNextAction model is immutable and deterministic, but `is_executable()` ignores `human_gate_required` despite the field documenting that approval must happen before execution; repair routed to Build 2.
2026-05-31 13:30 -06:00 - Reviewed coordinator commit 39c9ac8; result: finding/repair-routed; tests: `python -m pytest tests/test_prime_autonomy.py tests/test_bifrost_cockpit.py tests/test_bifrost_preview.py -q` 137 passed; `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py tests/test_prompt_metrics.py -q` 94 passed; notes: Prime human-gate repair passed; JARVIS-source runway direction is present, but Build 5 has contradictory stale active-task/path references that could send the builder to the old contract file; repair routed to Build 5.
2026-05-31 14:45 -06:00 - Reviewed Build 1 V2 runtime/code commits `2bccb55`, `7e95ede`, `638117f`, `b99ce1d`, and docs contract `57ed79a`; result: finding/repair-routed; tests: `python -m pytest tests/test_echo.py tests/test_atlas.py tests/test_prompt_payload_meter.py tests/test_relay_executor.py -q` 132 passed; `python -m pytest tests/test_cognition_policy.py tests/test_aegis.py tests/test_relay_executor.py -q` 157 passed; notes: Atlas, Relay policy/Aegis enforcement, and queue-runway contract review passed; Echo and prompt payload meter each have one MEDIUM failure-soft edge finding; repair routed to Build 1.
2026-05-31 14:57 -06:00 - Reviewed Build 1 repair commit `8e8c87b`; result: pass; tests: `python -m pytest tests/test_echo.py -q` 23 passed; `python -m pytest tests/test_prompt_payload_meter.py -q` 25 passed; `python -m pytest tests/test_echo.py tests/test_atlas.py tests/test_prompt_payload_meter.py tests/test_relay_executor.py -q` 136 passed; `python -m pytest tests/test_cognition_policy.py tests/test_aegis.py tests/test_relay_executor.py -q` 157 passed; notes: repair adds Echo datetime normalization/skip behavior plus prompt payload zero/negative budget guards and regression tests; no remaining CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW findings in this repair scope.
2026-05-31 15:12 -06:00 - Reviewed V2 Prime Session Lifecycle restart/resteer runtime slice; result: pass; tests: `python -m pytest tests/test_restart_resteer.py -q` 16 passed; `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py tests/test_restart_resteer.py -q` 62 passed; notes: current runtime includes the empty-review-queue repair in `40def3d`, contract signature correction, deterministic role-aware queue findings, and no repair routing needed.
2026-05-31 15:24 -06:00 - Reviewed Build 1 FileMap registration commit `9fa9cdf`; result: pass; tests: `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py -q` 46 passed; notes: FileMap now registers prompt payload meter and Prime Autonomy runtime/test paths in `make_default_map()`, `_REQUIRED_PATHS`, and `docs/FileMap.md`; after latest `origin/main`, Build 1 queue marker points to commit `9fa9cdf`.
2026-05-31 15:34 -06:00 - Reviewed Build 1 Prime queue runway policy repair commit `b13f10f`; result: pass; tests: not run (docs-only); notes: policy now rejects read-check-only commits as valid work, requires ahead-of-idle runway plus explicit cadence/review/human/provider gates, preserves worktree/queue/branch/cadence invariants, and Build 1 has a valid next Active Task after the completed repair.
2026-05-31 22:09 -06:00 - Reviewed Build 1 runtime cadence window `653488b`, `0560eb4`, `869faa4`, `f353c8d`, `f56af55`; result: finding/repair-routed; tests: `python -m pytest tests/test_model_adapter.py tests/test_relay_executor.py -q` 77 passed; `python -m pytest tests/test_cockpit_state.py -q` 25 passed; `python -m pytest tests/test_cognition_policy.py tests/test_aegis.py tests/test_relay_executor.py -q` 157 passed; notes: Model adapter registry, HTTP transport final repaired state, Relay registry dispatch, and Aegis proof gate behavior passed; `PrimeCockpitSnapshot` stores mutable list inputs and needs tuple normalization.
2026-05-31 22:17 -06:00 - Reviewed Build 2 checklist marker `0296525`; result: finding/repair-routed; tests: not run (docs-only review); notes: `docs/session-lifecycle-v2-contract.md` exists, but `docs/session-lifecycle-implementation-checklist.md` is missing from `HEAD`; `0296525` only changes `docs/live-build-2.md`, so the Ready marker cannot be accepted and the runtime task remains blocked.
2026-05-31 22:43 -06:00 - Reviewed Build 1 repair commit `19f4516`; result: pass; tests: `python -m pytest tests/test_cockpit_state.py -q` 29 passed; `python -m pytest tests/test_model_adapter.py tests/test_relay_executor.py -q` 86 passed; notes: `PrimeCockpitSnapshot.__post_init__()` converts mutable lane/event sequence inputs to tuples and regression tests prove source-list mutation no longer changes snapshot contents.
2026-06-01 15:55 -06:00 - Reviewed Build 1 Relay stop-condition repair commit `f0bb2bb6`; result: finding/repair-routed; tests: `python -m pytest tests/test_relay_executor.py -q` 121 passed; notes: registry metadata populates vendor and lane preferred model populates model_id, but Tier 2+ no-adapter vendor unknown can remain `fallback_allowed=True` with no explicit blocker; repair routed to Build 1.

## Proof Log

Append proof entries here before marking a slice passed.

Proof is the evidence behind the review result. It should be short, specific, and reproducible enough that Prime can later turn it into Aegis evidence or Review Console proof cards.

Minimum proof expectations:

- Runtime/code slices: targeted tests plus diff inspection.
- Package/API slices: import/export smoke check or targeted tests plus diff inspection.
- FileMap slices: `tests/test_filemap.py` plus path/reference verification.
- Docs/architecture slices: referenced-file existence checks plus contradiction/scope inspection.
- Repair verification: original finding, repair commit, and test/reference evidence that the finding is closed.

## Findings

Append findings here before routing repairs.

```text
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build <n> commit <hash>; severity: CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW; file: <path>; finding: <short note>; action: clear/defer/repair-task-written

2026-05-30 15:30 CDT - Round 1 sweep: no CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW findings across Build 1 (6af04d4, fd35a81), Build 2 (4be1117, bf15569), Build 3 (7ec16ac, ef934b1), Build 4 (736b6af), Build 5 (818bb31, d1d32af). All 9 reviewed commits cleared. No repair tasks routed.
2026-05-30 15:30 CDT - Observational (not a finding): Build 1 fd35a81 introduced meridian_core/relay_dispatch.py after Build 3's most recent FileMap refresh (ef934b1). Next Build 3 FileMap refresh should add a FileMapEntry for relay_dispatch.py and its tests. Not routed as a repair — this is normal forward FileMap work, not stale wording.
2026-05-31 16:30 CDT - Round 2 A-portion sweep: no CRITICAL, HIGH, or MEDIUM findings across Build 1 (d2820d2) and Build 2 (46e4eb3). Two LOW observational items only. No repair tasks routed.
2026-05-31 16:30 CDT - Build 1 commit d2820d2; severity: LOW; file: meridian_core/lane_state.py; finding: transition helpers use `value if value else self.value` pattern, so callers cannot pass `""` through the helpers to deliberately clear `active_task`/`last_commit`/`last_poll_at`/`notes` — they would need `dataclasses.replace` directly; `mark_blocked` and `mark_ready_for_review` also omit a `last_poll_at` parameter while `mark_running` accepts it (mild API asymmetry); action: defer — design choice, not a bug; revisit if Prime needs to clear fields through the helper surface.
2026-05-31 16:30 CDT - Build 2 commit 3e1de48; severity: LOW; file: docs/live-build-2.md (Codex Review Cadence section); finding: Build 2 self-recorded a "Codex review result: APPROVE" for commits 4be1117/bf15569/46e4eb3 at 16:55 -06:00, before Codex Reviews A had recorded a Round 2 result for 46e4eb3; coordinator queued Round 2 at 12:06 -06:00 the same minute, so this was likely a coordinator-driven cross-check rather than a procedural violation; action: defer — record only. Codex Reviews A's own Round 2 result (this entry) is the authoritative review of 46e4eb3.
2026-06-01 04:00 CDT - Round 3 A-portion sweep: no CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW findings for Build 2 d821106. Delegated Round C1 (Build 1 190e527, Build 2 e800c03, Build 2 989366f) was already cleared by Reviews C with one LOW deferred on route_to_console; that LOW is tracked in `docs/live-codex-reviews-3.md` and does not duplicate here. No repair tasks routed by Reviews A.
2026-05-31 12:55 -06:00 - Build 1 commit 8b4c8ac; severity: MEDIUM; file: meridian_core/restart_resteer.py; finding: committed `evaluate_lane_frame()` emits `EMPTY_QUEUE` for any lane with empty `active_task_id` and `next_candidate_id`, so an idle review/coordinator/proof lane can be resteered with "Assign one active executable task and one next candidate" even though the empty-queue runway rule is documented as a build-lane rule; action: repair-task-written to `docs/live-build-1.md`.
2026-05-31 12:55 -06:00 - Build 1 commit 27e1b1f + 8b4c8ac; severity: LOW; file: docs/prime-restart-resteer-contract.md; finding: contract documents `choose_recovery_action(findings)` but committed runtime implements `choose_recovery_action(frame, findings)`; action: repair-task-written to `docs/live-build-1.md` with the MEDIUM repair.
2026-05-31 13:04 -06:00 - Build 1 repair commit 40def3d; severity: LOW; file: commit scope; finding: repair commit also includes Build 2 Prime Autonomy product files (`meridian_core/prime_autonomy.py`, `tests/test_prime_autonomy.py`) outside the Round 5 repair verification scope; action: defer to Build 2 Ready marker review, no Build 1 repair required because restart/resteer repair passed.
2026-05-31 13:06 -06:00 - Build 2 commit 40def3d; severity: MEDIUM; file: meridian_core/prime_autonomy.py; finding: `PrimeNextAction.human_gate_required` says the action must wait for human approval before execution, but `is_executable()` ignores that flag and returns true for human-gated actions whenever blockers are empty; action: repair-task-written to `docs/live-build-2.md`.
2026-05-31 13:16 -06:00 - Reviews A idle queue cadence check; severity: LOW/none; file: docs/live-codex-reviews.md; finding: no actionable findings in the recent queue-only read-check/status updates; action: clear, no repair task written.

2026-05-31 13:30 -06:00 - Coordinator commit 39c9ac8; severity: MEDIUM; file: docs/live-build-5.md and docs/v2-detailed-build-plan.md; finding: Bifrost source-first runway is present, but Build 5 still has a lower stale executable `## Active Task` assigning `docs/bifrost-v2-extensions-contract.md`, and the V2 detailed plan's likely-files list still names that old contract path while `docs/v2-progress-tracker.md` names `docs/bifrost-v2-cockpit-extensions.md`; action: repair-task-written to `docs/live-build-5.md`.

2026-05-31 14:45 -06:00 - Build 1 commit 638117f; severity: MEDIUM; file: meridian_core/prompt_payload_meter.py; finding: `PromptPayloadSnapshot(..., budget_tokens=0).status` raises `ZeroDivisionError` through `budget_percent`, so a malformed/zero budget can crash the helper instead of returning deterministic status or validating the snapshot; action: repair-task-written to `docs/live-build-1.md`.
2026-05-31 14:45 -06:00 - Build 1 commit 2bccb55; severity: MEDIUM; file: meridian_core/echo.py; finding: `EchoRepository.query()` promises failure-soft behavior for corrupt records, but a naive `created_at` timestamp raises `TypeError` during recency scoring instead of skipping/normalizing the bad record; action: repair-task-written to `docs/live-build-1.md`.
2026-05-31 22:09 -06:00 - Build 1 commit f56af55; severity: MEDIUM; file: meridian_core/cockpit_state.py; finding: `PrimeCockpitSnapshot` is frozen and documents immutable snapshot semantics, but direct construction accepts mutable `lanes`/`progress_events` lists and stores them unchanged, allowing external mutation after construction; action: repair-task-written to `docs/live-build-1.md`.
2026-05-31 14:55 -06:00 - Reviews A idle queue cadence check; severity: LOW/none; file: docs/live-codex-reviews.md; finding: no actionable findings in the recent queue-only read-check/status updates or already-routed Build 1 repair record; action: clear, no repair task written.

2026-06-01 15:55 -06:00 - Routed repair to Build 1; queue: docs/live-build-1.md; finding: missing safe vendor metadata for Tier 2+ must become an explicit blocking fallback blocker, not only `vendor='unknown'`; status: pending.
2026-06-01 16:04 -06:00 - Routed repair to Build 1; queue: docs/live-build-1.md; finding: Ready-for-review commits `c3d91214` and `69e9ff55` are not visible in current `origin/main`, so Reviews A cannot clear the Relay repair until the approved branch path lands or requeues a current-main target; status: pending.
2026-06-01 16:28 -06:00 - Routed repair to Build 2; queue: docs/live-build-2.md; finding: Session Lifecycle routing-action implementation lacks required archive/request-human-gate action representation and lacks reachable/tested context-fill, review-gate, and permission-boundary reasons; status: pending.

## Coordinator Addendum - Planning Harness Review

2026-05-30 15:12 MDT - Reviewed Planning Harness commit `2c90247` plus grill-with-docs anchor `0f0ecbd`.

Result: pass. No actionable findings. No repairs routed.

Proof:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_planning.py tests/test_council.py tests/test_package_api.py tests/test_filemap.py -q` -> 88 passed.
- `python -m pytest -q` -> 881 passed.
- Diff inspection: `meridian_core/planning.py` is deterministic/domain-only, Council-owned, package-exported, FileMap-registered, and has no file/network/vendor calls.
- Documentation inspection: `docs/planning-harness-council-brief.md` names `mattpocock/skills` and `skills/engineering/grill-with-docs`; `docs/meridian-pillars.md` adds Pillar 15 requiring docs/code/context interrogation before durable plans.

## Archived Prior Active Review Task - Do Not Execute

Round 3 complete (2026-06-01 04:00 CDT).

- Build 2 d821106 (Relay executor API policy note): passed — policy correctly defers exports as future work; verified by grep that none of the 5 names (ModelCallFn, RelayExecutionResult, RelayExecutionError, RelayExecutionSummary, execute_relay_dispatch_plan) appear in meridian_core/__init__.py.
- Reviews C Round C1 delegated scope verified complete in docs/live-codex-reviews-3.md: Build 1 190e527 (Relay executor skeleton), Build 2 e800c03 (prime_wake), Build 2 989366f (prime_console/prime_status/route_to_console) — all passed with one LOW deferred (route_to_console type-vs-semantics doc note).

Build 2 cadence cleared for the three-commit window ending at 989366f. Build 1 cadence cleared by Reviews C for the window covering 190e527. No repairs routed by Reviews A in Round 3.
