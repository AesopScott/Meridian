# Live Codex Reviews Queue

This file is the standing queue for the specialized Codex Reviews session.

The build lanes build. This lane reviews.

This queue is also a Prime prototype. The checkpoint ledger, review scope declaration, repair routing, and lane-clearing logic are not throwaway process. They are intended to become part of Meridian's orchestration harness: Prime should eventually own this loop natively instead of relying on humans to paste work between sessions.

When idle, check this file every 30 seconds. Also inspect `docs/live-build-1.md` through `docs/live-build-5.md` for slices marked `Ready for Codex Review`, stale active tasks, or repair completions.

## Rules

- Treat this workflow as future Prime behavior: review state, checkpoints, scope, and repair routing are orchestration-harness responsibilities.
- Always pull latest `origin/main` before reviewing.
- Do not implement product code.
- Do not edit runtime files, package exports, tests, or architecture docs except when an Active Task explicitly says this review lane may update queue/review records.
- Own review coordination files and live queue routing only.
- Review completed build slices by commit hash.
- Inspect the diff, compare it to the lane's allowed files and task text, and run targeted tests when code changed.
- For docs-only slices, inspect for stale claims, contradictions, missing references, and scope drift.
- Record each review result in this file.
- If there are no actionable findings, mark the source build lane clear and eligible for new work.
- If there are actionable findings, write a repair Active Task back into the original build lane's queue file. The original builder repairs its own slice.
- CRITICAL and HIGH findings block the lane until repaired.
- MEDIUM findings should usually be repaired before more work unless the finding is intentionally deferred by Codex.
- LOW findings may be deferred, but must be recorded.
- After every three task-changing commits from any one build lane, perform a cadence review before that lane receives more normal build work.
- Update Obsidian build notes in `G:\My Drive\Aesop Academy\Obsidian\Meridian_Build` when a review finds or clears important issues.

## Review Inputs

Poll these files:

- `docs/live-build-1.md`
- `docs/live-build-2.md`
- `docs/live-build-3.md`
- `docs/live-build-4.md`
- `docs/live-build-5.md`

Look for:

- `Ready for Codex Review`
- completed commits without a review result
- three-commit cadence triggers
- CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW findings
- stale Active Task sections that were already completed
- repair tasks waiting for verification

## Checkpoint Ledger

This is the review lane's cursor. Update it after every review pass so the next poll knows exactly what has and has not been cleared.

| Build lane | Last reviewed commit | Last reviewed task | Review status | Pending finding / repair | Next action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Build 1 | pending | Relay PromptPacket assembly helper | pending review | none recorded yet | review `6af04d4` |
| Build 2 | pending | PromptPacket package API note cleanup | pending review | possible stale validation-contract wording | review `4be1117` |
| Build 3 | pending | FileMap refresh | pending review | possible stale Relay/PromptBudget maturity wording | review `7ec16ac` |
| Build 4 | pending | Architecture consistency pass | pending review | none recorded yet | review `736b6af` |
| Build 5 | pending | Bifrost cockpit queue status brief | pending review | none recorded yet | review `818bb31` |

Checkpoint rules:

- `Last reviewed commit` must be an actual commit hash, not "latest".
- `Review status` must be one of: `pending review`, `passed`, `repair routed`, `repair pending verification`, `blocked`, `deferred`.
- When a repair is routed, keep the original commit in `Last reviewed commit` and put the repair requirement in `Pending finding / repair`.
- When the repair lands and passes verification, update `Last reviewed commit` to the repair commit and set `Review status` to `passed`.
- Do not advance a lane's checkpoint just because a newer commit exists. Advance only after review.
- If multiple commits land before the next review, review the full range from the checkpoint to the newest completed commit and record the range in `Last reviewed task`.

## Review Round Scope

Before starting each review round, write the scope here. This prevents the review lane from silently reviewing a different set of files than the build lane intended.

```text
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Round <n> scope
Build lanes: <Build 1, Build 2, ...>
Commit range(s): <Build 1 abc..def; Build 2 ghi>
Allowed review files: <files or "diff files only">
Tests to run: <targeted tests or docs-only>
Out of scope: <files/areas explicitly not reviewed>
Reason: <ready marker, cadence review, repair verification, user request>
```

Scope rules:

- Declare scope before reading deeply or writing findings.
- If scope changes mid-review, add a new scope entry instead of silently broadening it.
- Review only files changed by the target commit/range unless the scope explicitly names supporting files needed for correctness.
- If the changed files include areas owned by another active lane, record that as a scope concern before reviewing.
- For repair verification, scope is the repair commit plus the original finding.
- For cadence review, scope is the lane's commits since the last passed checkpoint.

## Read Checks

Append entries here when this file is checked while idle.

```text
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Codex Reviews checked queue; status: idle/running/blocked; notes: <short note>
```

## Review Log

Append one entry per reviewed slice.

```text
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Reviewed Build <n> commit <hash>; result: pass/finding/blocked; tests: <summary>; notes: <short note>
```

## Findings

Append findings here before routing repairs.

```text
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build <n> commit <hash>; severity: CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW; file: <path>; finding: <short note>; action: clear/defer/repair-task-written
```

## Repair Routing Log

Append entries when writing repair work into a build lane.

```text
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Routed repair to Build <n>; queue: docs/live-build-<n>.md; finding: <short note>; status: pending
```

## Active Task

Goal: perform the first centralized review sweep.

Allowed files only:

- `docs/live-codex-reviews.md`
- `docs/live-build-1.md`
- `docs/live-build-2.md`
- `docs/live-build-3.md`
- `docs/live-build-4.md`
- `docs/live-build-5.md`

Task:

- Pull latest `origin/main`.
- Read the Checkpoint Ledger first.
- Inspect Build 1 through Build 5 live queues.
- Find completed commits newer than each lane's checkpoint or marked `Ready for Codex Review`.
- Write a Review Round Scope entry before detailed review.
- Review, at minimum, the latest completed slices:
  - Build 1: `6af04d4` Relay PromptPacket assembly helper
  - Build 2: `4be1117` PromptPacket package API note cleanup
  - Build 3: `7ec16ac` FileMap refresh
  - Build 4: `736b6af` architecture consistency pass
  - Build 5: `818bb31` Bifrost cockpit queue status brief
- Run targeted tests for code slices.
- Record pass/finding results in this file.
- Update the Checkpoint Ledger for every reviewed lane.
- If a finding needs repair, write a repair Active Task into the original build lane's queue.
- Do not implement the repair yourself.

Completion:

- Commit only review/queue file changes.
- Push to `origin/main`.
- Update Obsidian if findings or clearances are important.
- Report review results in the Codex Reviews session.
