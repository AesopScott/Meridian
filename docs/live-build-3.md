# Live Build 3 Queue

This file is the standing assignment queue for Build 3.

When idle, check this file every 30 seconds. If there is an active task below, execute it. If the task is complete, commit and push your slice, update Obsidian, then report completion in your session and return to polling this file.

Rules:

- This session must behave as a live worker, not a one-shot handoff. After completing a task, return to this file and keep polling every 30 seconds.
- If there is no Active Task, do not stop. Append a Read Checks entry, wait 30 seconds, pull latest, and check again.
- Always pull latest `origin/main` before editing.
- Every time you check/read this file, add a timestamped entry to the Read Checks section.
- Every time you modify this file or complete a task from it, add a timestamped entry to the Write/Completion Log section.
- Every minute while idle, check for cross-check activity relevant to your slice: review notes, Codex findings, Aegis findings, failing tests, or Obsidian build log updates.
- If cross-check activity affects your task, record it in this file's Cross-Check Activity section and address it before starting unrelated work.
- After completing a task, mark the slice `Ready for Codex Review` with commit hash, files changed, and tests run.
- Do not perform your own Codex review. A separate Codex Reviews lane owns independent review, findings, and repair routing.
- If the Codex Reviews lane writes a repair task into this file, complete that repair before taking unrelated work.
- After every three completed task-changing commits, pause normal build work until the Codex Reviews lane records a cadence review result.
- Use local time with timezone when possible.
- Own only the files listed in the active task.
- Do not edit Build 1 or Build 2 live queue files.
- Do not edit files owned by another active build task.
- Keep scope tight.
- Run the requested tests.
- Commit only your slice.
- Push to `origin/main`.
- Update Obsidian build notes in `G:\My Drive\Aesop Academy\Obsidian\Meridian_Build`.
- Mark completed slices `Ready for Codex Review` in this file. Include commit hash, files changed, and tests run so `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` can clear or route repairs.

## Active Task

Current Active Task (supersedes stale completed FileMap task below):

Goal: dumb-fast FileMap registration for the V3 parking lot.

Context:

- Build 4 is a smart queue and created `docs/v3-parking-lot.md` in commit `18e2767`.
- Build 3 is the dumb fast queue. Its job here is only mechanical registration and test coverage.
- Do not evaluate, rewrite, or expand the V3 parking lot content.

Allowed files:

- `docs/FileMap.md`
- `meridian_core/filemap.py`
- `tests/test_filemap.py`
- `docs/live-build-3.md`

Task:

- Register `docs/v3-parking-lot.md` in both `docs/FileMap.md` and `meridian_core/filemap.py` if missing.
- Use the existing FileArea taxonomy; this is likely architecture/roadmap/build-process adjacent. Pick the closest existing category and keep it consistent with similar roadmap docs.
- Add `docs/v3-parking-lot.md` to `_REQUIRED_PATHS` if that matches the existing test convention.
- Keep `docs/FileMap.md` row prose and `meridian_core/filemap.py` entry prose aligned.
- If you notice `docs/v1-capability-plan.md`, `docs/v1-bifrost-cockpit-implementation-brief.md`, or `docs/v2-horizon-plan.md` are still missing from FileMap, record that in Cross-Check Activity but do not bundle them into this slice unless the edit stays extremely small and mechanical.
- Do not edit runtime behavior outside FileMap metadata.
- Do not edit other live queues except this queue's read/completion log.

Tests:

- Run `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py -q`.

Completion:

- Commit only this hygiene slice.
- Push to `origin/main`.
- Update Obsidian.
- Mark this slice `Ready for Codex Review` with commit hash, files changed, and tests run.

**COMPLETED 2026-05-31 16:05 -06:00. Commit: 774695f. Tests: 46/46 filemap. Ready for Codex Review — files: docs/FileMap.md, meridian_core/filemap.py, tests/test_filemap.py, docs/v0-build-readiness-map.md. Cadence: 1/3 since Round B2.**

**COMPLETED 2026-05-31 21:05 -06:00. Commit: pending. Tests: 46/46 filemap. Ready for Codex Review — files: docs/FileMap.md, meridian_core/filemap.py, tests/test_filemap.py. Cadence: 2/3 since Round B2.**

**No active task. Build 3 is idle.**

Stale prior text follows.

Goal: FileMap follow-up repair from Codex Reviews B Round B2.

Background:

- Codex Reviews B Round B2 verified Build 3 commit `1378bda`.
- The original Round B1 MEDIUM repair is closed: the four routed docs are now registered and `tests/test_filemap.py` passed.
- Round B2 found one new MEDIUM FileMap gap: `docs/live-codex-reviews-2.md` exists and is still uncatalogued.

Allowed files:

- `docs/FileMap.md`
- `meridian_core/filemap.py`
- `tests/test_filemap.py`
- `docs/live-build-3.md`

Task:

- Register `docs/live-codex-reviews-2.md` in `docs/FileMap.md`.
- Add the matching `FileMapEntry` in `meridian_core/filemap.py`, parallel to the existing `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` entry.
- Add `docs/live-codex-reviews-2.md` to `_REQUIRED_PATHS` in `tests/test_filemap.py`.
- Opportunistically, if it stays small and safe, reconcile the two LOW prose-divergence carryovers for:
  - `docs/live-codex-reviews.md`
  - `docs/prime-orchestration-harness-prototype.md`
- Do not edit runtime behavior outside FileMap metadata.
- Do not edit other live queues except this queue's read/completion log.

Proof required:

- Run `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py -q`.
- Include the test result in the completion marker.

Completion:

- Commit only this repair slice.
- Push to `origin/main`.
- Update Obsidian.
- Mark this slice `Ready for Codex Review` with commit hash, files changed, and tests run. Reviews B will verify in Round B3.

Stale prior text follows.

Goal: FileMap refresh — register four uncatalogued architecture/strategy docs (Codex Reviews B Round B1 finding).

Background:

- Codex Reviews B Round B1 (2026-05-30 23:30 -06:00) reviewed Build 3 commit 4075ef4 (PASS), Build 4 commit 1d17fa1 (PASS), Build 5 commit 7c34566 (PASS).
- During the Build 4 and Build 5 reviews, Round B1 confirmed four docs currently exist on disk but are absent from both `docs/FileMap.md` and `meridian_core/filemap.py`.
- Build 4 explicitly defers FileMap edits to Build 3 in `docs/prime-orchestration-state-model.md` §"What This Is Not". Build 5 explicitly disclaims FileMap edits in `docs/bifrost-harness-dashboard-brief.md` §15. The gap therefore lives in Build 3's owned scope.

Files to add to FileMap (both `docs/FileMap.md` and `meridian_core/filemap.py`):

- `docs/v0-build-readiness-map.md` — Build 4-owned V0 gap analysis (created in commit `3cbf336`).
- `docs/prime-orchestration-state-model.md` — Build 4-owned state model bridge to Python domain objects (created in commit `1d17fa1`).
- `docs/bifrost-v0-cockpit-layout-brief.md` — Build 5-owned V0 cockpit layout brief (created in commit `d1d32af`).
- `docs/bifrost-harness-dashboard-brief.md` — Build 5-owned Harness dashboard surface brief (created in commit `7c34566`).

Allowed files:

- `docs/FileMap.md`
- `meridian_core/filemap.py`
- `tests/test_filemap.py`
- `docs/live-build-3.md`

Required process:

1. Pull latest `origin/main`.
2. Append timestamped Read Check entry; record cross-check entry citing Round B1 finding.
3. Add one FileMap.md row and one `FileMapEntry` for each of the four docs, using the area taxonomy already in `FileArea` (likely `ARCHITECTURE` for state model and V0 readiness map; `BIFROST` for both Bifrost briefs). Keep the row prose in `docs/FileMap.md` and the entry prose in `meridian_core/filemap.py` consistent — see Round B1 LOW finding about prose divergence in the `live-codex-reviews.md` / `prime-orchestration-harness-prototype.md` entries.
4. Add each path to `_REQUIRED_PATHS` in `tests/test_filemap.py` if appropriate, or extend the doc-path coverage assertions if a separate docs list is the convention.
5. Run `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py -q` and the full suite if reasonable; capture results in the completion entry.
6. Commit only these files. Push to `origin/main`.
7. Mark slice Ready for Codex Review with commit hash, files changed, and tests run so Reviews B can verify the repair.
8. Update Obsidian build notes.

Out of scope:

- Editing the Build 4 or Build 5 source docs themselves.
- Adding any other docs to FileMap unless they were also created since 4075ef4 and currently lack entries (note them in the cross-check section, do not silently bundle).
- Reconciling the LOW prose-divergence finding from Round B1 against `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` and `docs/prime-orchestration-harness-prototype.md` — that can be folded into this slice opportunistically, but is not required for the repair to pass.

Completion marker: Ready for Codex Review with commit hash, files changed, tests run. Reviews B will verify in Round B2.

**COMPLETED 2026-05-31 00:35 -06:00. Commit: 1378bda. Tests: 46/46 filemap, 785/785 full suite. Ready for Codex Review — Reviews B Round B2.**
