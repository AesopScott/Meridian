# Live Build 3 Queue

## Queue Authority

Only the first `Active Task` block in this file is executable. Lower archived/stale active-task sections are historical context only and must not be executed unless Prime/Codex promotes them back to the top of the file.

## Cadence Cleared

Build 3 cadence for commit `67a75dc` plus marker `b3316b6` was cleared by Codex Reviews B on 2026-05-31 15:52 -06:00. FileMap tests passed (46 tests), and no repair was routed.

## Active Task

Goal: register new V2 contract-wave documents in FileMap.

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/filemap.py`, `tests/test_filemap.py`, `docs/live-build-3.md`.

Task: inspect current FileMap registrations and add missing entries for the new V2 contract-wave documents only if they are not already discoverable:

- `docs/session-lifecycle-v2-contract.md`
- `docs/federation-harness-horizon.md`
- `docs/session-card-queue-activation-contract.md`
- `docs/deepseek-provider-validation-gate.md`

Keep this mechanical and small. Do not edit the documents themselves. Add or update tests only for required-path/default-map coverage.

Tests: `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py -q`.

Completion: commit only this FileMap registration slice, push, update Obsidian, and mark Ready for Codex Review.

## Next Candidate Task

Goal: add a lightweight FileMap audit note for V2/V3 discoverability.

Allowed files only: `docs/filemap-v2-v3-discoverability-audit.md`, `docs/live-build-3.md`.

Task: create a short docs-only audit listing which V2/V3 architecture files must be discoverable by Prime at wake. Mark any missing registrations as follow-up tasks rather than editing runtime code.

This file is the standing assignment queue for Build 3.

When idle, check this file every 30 seconds. If there is an active task below, execute it. If the task is complete, commit and push your slice, update Obsidian, then report completion in your session and return to polling this file.

Rules:

- This session must behave as a live worker, not a one-shot handoff. After completing a task, return to this file and keep polling every 30 seconds.
- Before editing any task file, verify you are in your own unique worktree. If you are in `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian` main worktree or sharing a worktree with another lane, stop and report the worktree violation instead of editing.
- If there is no Active Task, do not stop. Append a Read Checks entry, wait 30 seconds, pull latest, and check again.
- Always pull latest `origin/main` before editing.
- Every time you check/read this file, add a timestamped entry to the Read Checks section.
- Every time you modify this file or complete a task from it, add a timestamped entry to the Write/Completion Log section.
- Every minute while idle, check for cross-check activity relevant to your slice: review notes, Codex findings, Aegis findings, failing tests, or Obsidian build log updates.
- If cross-check activity affects your task, record it in this file's Cross-Check Activity section and address it before starting unrelated work.
- After completing a task, mark the slice `Ready for Codex Review` with commit hash, files changed, and tests run.
- Do not perform your own Codex review. A separate Codex Reviews lane owns independent review, findings, and repair routing.
- If the Codex Reviews lane writes a repair task into this file, complete that repair before taking unrelated work.
- After every three completed task-changing commits, pause normal build work until the Codex Reviews lane records a cadence review result.
- Use local time with timezone when possible.
- Own only the files listed in the active task.
- Do not edit Build 1 or Build 2 live queue files.
- Do not edit files owned by another active build task.
- Keep scope tight.
- Run the requested tests.
- Commit only your slice.
- Push to `origin/main`.
- Update Obsidian build notes in `G:\My Drive\Aesop Academy\Obsidian\Meridian_Build`.
- Mark completed slices `Ready for Codex Review` in this file. Include commit hash, files changed, and tests run so `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` can clear or route repairs.

## Archived Prior Active Task - Do Not Execute

Current Active Task - COMPLETED:

Coordinator Override task completed in commit `67a75dc`: Registered V1 Electron cockpit app shell (package.json, electron/main.js), Bifrost preview renderer (bifrost/preview.py, tests/test_bifrost_preview.py), and Prime queue reconciliation requirement (docs/prime-queue-reconciliation-requirement.md) in FileMap. All 5 entries now present with FileArea.BIFROST and FileArea.ARCHITECTURE classifications. Tests: 46/46 filemap passing. Ready for Codex Review.

Next Active Task: awaiting new assignment.

Prior stale task archived below.

Current Active Task:

Goal: register the V2 detailed build plan in FileMap.

Context:

- Codex coordinator completed the V2 detailed build plan in commit `71b8d5f`.
- `docs/v2-detailed-build-plan.md` is a new architecture/build-planning document and is not yet registered in FileMap.
- Build 3 owns FileMap registration.
- The previous Prime cockpit provider FileMap task is already complete: `meridian_core/cockpit_provider.py` and `tests/test_cockpit_provider.py` are present in `docs/FileMap.md`, `meridian_core/filemap.py`, and `_REQUIRED_PATHS`.

Allowed files only:

- `docs/FileMap.md`
- `meridian_core/filemap.py`
- `tests/test_filemap.py`
- `docs/live-build-3.md`

Task:

- Add FileMap coverage for:
  - `docs/v2-detailed-build-plan.md`
- Use the established architecture/build-planning taxonomy near `docs/v2-horizon-plan.md`, `docs/v1-capability-plan.md`, and `docs/v3-parking-lot.md`.
- Add required-path coverage in `tests/test_filemap.py`.
- Do not edit the V2 plan content.

Tests:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py -q`

Completion:

- Commit only this FileMap slice.
- Push to `origin/main`.
- Update Obsidian in `G:\My Drive\Aesop Academy\Obsidian\Meridian_Build`.
- Mark this slice `Ready for Codex Review` with commit hash, files changed, and tests run.

Poll every 30 seconds. When a new task is written here, begin immediately.

Last completed: Prime cockpit provider FileMap registration was already present and review-repaired; next active assignment is the V2 detailed build plan FileMap entry.
