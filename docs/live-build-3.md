# Live Build 3 Queue

## Required First Command For Every New Task

You must do all work inside your assigned unique worktree. You are not allowed to write to `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian` main or push/write to `main` without explicit coordinator approval. Do not move data between worktrees, branches, or the main checkout. Do not cherry-pick, copy files, stash-pop across worktrees, merge, rebase, reset, or salvage. If you believe work must move, stop and ask the coordinator. The coordinator may permit it only after verifying `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian` main is clean.

## Queue Authority

Only the first `Active Task` block in this file is executable. Lower archived/stale active-task sections are historical context only and must not be executed unless Prime/Codex promotes them back to the top of the file.

## Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: keep FileMap current after the repaired Bifrost voice runtime/status surface landed on current `origin/main`.

Worktree: `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\build-3-filemap`.

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/filemap.py`, `docs/FileMap.md`, `tests/test_filemap.py`, `docs/live-build-3.md`.

Task: concrete FileMap audit after the repaired Bifrost voice landing, including Bifrost runtime/frontend/test paths, live queue provenance, Reviews B clearance, and existing voice/source docs.

Completion:

- First status check was clean on `codex/build-3-filemap-post-voice-main-20260602-1110`; the branch was behind `origin/main`, so Build 3 audited visible `origin/main` refs without merge, rebase, reset, cherry-pick, branch movement, shared-main writes, or Polaris access.
- Refreshed audit evidence against visible `origin/main` at `c256a8d1`; current `HEAD..origin/main` changed-path scope was 7 paths: `docs/FileMap.md`, `docs/live-build-1.md`, `docs/live-build-2.md`, `docs/live-build-3.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`, `meridian_core/filemap.py`, and `tests/test_filemap.py`.
- Inspected called-out voice landing paths: `bifrost/cockpit.py`, `bifrost/static/cockpit.css`, `bifrost/preview.html`, `tests/test_bifrost_cockpit.py`, and `docs/live-codex-reviews-2.md`.
- Inspected current FileMap surfaces, all five live-build queues, both live review provenance files, and existing Bifrost voice/source docs including `docs/bifrost-voice-command-contract.md`, `docs/bifrost-v2-cockpit-extensions.md`, `bifrost/preview.py`, and `tests/test_bifrost_preview.py`.
- Registered missing existing artifact: `bifrost/preview.html` in runtime FileMap, `docs/FileMap.md`, and `_REQUIRED_PATHS`.
- Repaired mirror-only drift in `docs/FileMap.md` for existing registered artifacts: `docs/bifrost-voice-command-contract.md`, `bifrost/preview.py`, and `tests/test_bifrost_preview.py`.
- Audit evidence: focused coverage check across 47 inspected current-scope FileMap-relevant existing paths found zero remaining runtime FileMap, `docs/FileMap.md`, or `_REQUIRED_PATHS` gaps after registration.
- Files changed: `meridian_core/filemap.py`, `docs/FileMap.md`, `tests/test_filemap.py`, `docs/live-build-3.md`.
- Tests: `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py -q` - 47 passed.
- Diff proof: `git diff --check` - passed with line-ending normalization warnings only.
- Commit: this queue-marker commit.
- Next Candidate: bind runtime validation or review findings before unrelated FileMap cleanup.

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/filemap.py`, `docs/FileMap.md`, `tests/test_filemap.py`, `docs/live-build-3.md`.

Task: concrete FileMap audit after command-staging review packet movement, current live queue/review provenance, and current `origin/main`.

Completion:

- Build 3 audited current `origin/main` at `70ab73e8` after movement from the prompt-meter FileMap landing `5ba404ef..HEAD`.
- Inspected changed/referenced paths from `5ba404ef..HEAD` (9 changed paths), all five live-build queue files, both live review provenance files, runtime FileMap entries, `docs/FileMap.md`, and `_REQUIRED_PATHS`.
- Inspected called-out command-staging paths: `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py`, `tests/test_session_lifecycle.py`, `docs/live-build-2.md`, `docs/live-codex-reviews.md`, plus existing Prime/Beacon/session docs referenced by those queue changes.
- Also inspected the current Relay prompt-meter edge consumer paths from the same movement: `meridian_core/relay_executor.py` and `tests/test_relay_executor.py`.
- No missing existing artifacts were found. No runtime FileMap, `docs/FileMap.md`, or `_REQUIRED_PATHS` registration changes were needed.
- Out-of-scope evidence: `.mcp.json` remains excluded as Polaris MCP connector config per no-touch-Polaris instructions.
- Audit evidence: focused coverage check across 43 inspected FileMap-relevant changed/referenced existing paths found zero gaps.
- Files changed: `docs/live-build-3.md`.
- Tests: `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py -q` - 47 passed.
- Diff proof: `git diff --check` - passed.
- Commit: this queue-marker commit.

Required first command for this task: verify you are in your assigned unique worktree and not in `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian`; you are not allowed to write to main, move data between worktrees or branches, cherry-pick, copy files, stash-pop across worktrees, merge, rebase, reset, or salvage without coordinator approval.

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/filemap.py`, `docs/FileMap.md`, `tests/test_filemap.py`, `docs/live-build-3.md`.

Required sources: current `origin/main`, `docs/v2-progress-tracker.md`, current runtime FileMap entries, `docs/FileMap.md`, and recent Ready/completion markers in `docs/live-build-1.md`, `docs/live-build-2.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`, `docs/live-build-5.md`, `docs/live-codex-reviews.md`, and `docs/live-codex-reviews-2.md`.

Task: poll for new V2/V3 contract or architecture documents that have landed on `origin/main` but are not yet discoverable in runtime FileMap, mirrored in `docs/FileMap.md`, and covered by `_REQUIRED_PATHS`. Register any missing existing files following the same mechanical pattern. Keep this narrow; do not edit the docs themselves, Relay behavior, Bifrost UI, Aegis, Session Lifecycle, model/account/process code, branches, or Polaris.

Tests:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py -q`

Completion: mark Ready for Codex Review with commit hash, files changed, tests run, missing-file/no-op audit result, and a concrete Next Candidate: bind any review findings from this FileMap slice before unrelated FileMap cleanup.

Completion:

- Build 3 audited current-main V2/domain/contract/checklist coverage after coordinator sync and registered missing existing artifacts in runtime FileMap, `docs/FileMap.md`, and `_REQUIRED_PATHS`.
- Registered missing docs/contracts/checklists: `docs/relay-heartbeat-model-routing-implementation-checklist.md`, `docs/deepseek-direct-provider-implementation-handoff.md`, `docs/aegis-relay-summary-handoff-contract.md`, `docs/echo-atlas-handoff-contract.md`, `docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-prime-beacon-contract.md`, `docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md`, `docs/queue-runway-runtime-object.md`, `docs/live-build-active-polling-contract.md`, `docs/v2-orchestrator-handoff-20260601.md`, `docs/v2-orchestrator-transition-ledger.md`, `docs/relay-executor-api-policy.md`, `docs/relay-package-api-policy-note.md`, and `docs/prompt-packet-implementation-checklist.md`.
- Registered newly audited queue/test artifacts missing partial coverage: `docs/live-build-1.md`, `docs/live-build-2.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`, `docs/live-build-5.md`, and `tests/test_model_adapter.py`.
- Verified newly named current-main runtime/test artifacts were covered: `meridian_core/model_adapter.py`, `tests/test_session_lifecycle.py`, `bifrost/cockpit.py`, `bifrost/static/cockpit.css`, and `tests/test_bifrost_cockpit.py`.
- Files changed: `meridian_core/filemap.py`, `docs/FileMap.md`, `tests/test_filemap.py`.
- Tests: `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py -q` - 46 passed.
- Commit: `25bc316b`.
- Queue marker: this completion update.
- Next Candidate: bind any review findings from this FileMap slice before unrelated FileMap cleanup.

## Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: audit FileMap coverage for the current-main Relay UI/runtime integration landing.

Coordinator nudge: this is not a passive poll. Execute this FileMap audit now; the current check shows `meridian_core/relay_logic_snapshot.py` and `tests/test_relay_logic_snapshot.py` are present on current main but not yet registered in FileMap coverage.

Escalation: if this lane cannot complete the FileMap registration in the next work cycle, write a concrete blocker in this queue with the command/output evidence. Do not add a read-check-only commit.

Replacement coordinator supervised escalation - 2026-06-02:

- Shared main was fetched and verified clean on `main`; Build 3 worktree was verified clean before this routing update.
- Intake evidence still shows no completion or concrete blocker for this task.
- Targeted FileMap search found existing registration for `docs/relay-completeness-audit.md`, `docs/relay-heartbeat-model-routing-logic.md`, and `docs/ui-integration-checklist.md`, but no FileMap coverage hits for `meridian_core/relay_logic_snapshot.py`, `tests/test_relay_logic_snapshot.py`, `scripts/meridian-model-bridge.js`, or `index.html` in `meridian_core/filemap.py`, `docs/FileMap.md`, or `tests/test_filemap.py`.
- Execute this task now. If any listed file should not be registered, write a concrete blocker here naming the file, the command used to inspect it, and the reason it is out of FileMap scope. A read-check-only update is not progress.

Worktree: `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\build-3-filemap`.

Required first command for this task: verify you are in your assigned unique worktree and not in `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian`; you are not allowed to write to main, move data between worktrees or branches, cherry-pick, copy files, stash-pop across worktrees, merge, rebase, reset, or salvage without coordinator approval.

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/filemap.py`, `docs/FileMap.md`, `tests/test_filemap.py`, `docs/live-build-3.md`.

Required sources: `docs/live-build-1.md`, `docs/live-build-2.md`, `docs/live-codex-reviews.md`, `docs/live-codex-reviews-2.md`, `docs/v2-progress-tracker.md`, current runtime FileMap entries, `docs/FileMap.md`, and current `origin/main` commits `1b9c43db` through `7b50ab8e`.

Task: compare the current-main Relay harness UI/runtime integration files against runtime FileMap, `docs/FileMap.md`, and required-path coverage. At minimum inspect `meridian_core/relay_logic_snapshot.py`, `tests/test_relay_logic_snapshot.py`, `scripts/meridian-model-bridge.js`, `index.html`, `docs/relay-completeness-audit.md`, `docs/relay-heartbeat-model-routing-logic.md`, and `docs/ui-integration-checklist.md`. Register only missing existing files that belong in FileMap. Keep this mechanical; do not edit Relay behavior, Bifrost UI, Aegis, review queues, process/model/account code, branches, or Polaris.

Tests:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py -q`

Completion: mark Ready for Codex Review with commit hash, files changed, tests run, missing-file audit result, and a concrete Next Candidate: register any remaining V2/V3 architecture or domain contract docs that land without FileMap coverage before unrelated FileMap cleanup.

Completion:

- Build 3 registered the four missing current-main Relay UI/runtime integration files in FileMap: `meridian_core/relay_logic_snapshot.py`, `tests/test_relay_logic_snapshot.py`, `scripts/meridian-model-bridge.js`, and `index.html`.
- Audit result: `docs/relay-completeness-audit.md`, `docs/relay-heartbeat-model-routing-logic.md`, and `docs/ui-integration-checklist.md` were already registered in runtime FileMap, `docs/FileMap.md`, and `_REQUIRED_PATHS`; no blockers.
- Files changed: `meridian_core/filemap.py`, `docs/FileMap.md`, `tests/test_filemap.py`.
- Tests: `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py -q` - 46 passed.

## Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: repair duplicate `docs/ui-integration-checklist.md` mirror rows in `docs/FileMap.md` found during Reviews B review of Build 5 right-panel FileMap registration.

Allowed files only: `docs/FileMap.md`, `meridian_core/filemap.py`, `tests/test_filemap.py`, `docs/live-build-3.md`.

Finding: `docs/FileMap.md` contains two rows for `docs/ui-integration-checklist.md` with different areas/purposes (`Build process` and `Bifrost / session harness`), while `meridian_core/filemap.py` and `tests/test_filemap.py` contain one canonical entry. Why it matters: FileMap consumers and docs readers can see contradictory ownership and purpose for the same UI checklist artifact, weakening the Build 5 right-panel/UI checklist coverage guarantee. Recommended owning lane: Build 3.

Task: keep the canonical `docs/ui-integration-checklist.md` coverage consistent across runtime FileMap, `docs/FileMap.md`, and `tests/test_filemap.py`; remove or consolidate duplicate stale FileMap.md row(s) without editing UI/runtime code.

Completion:

- Build 3 removed duplicate `docs/ui-integration-checklist.md` row (Bifrost / session harness area) from docs/FileMap.md. Kept canonical Build process area row.
- Files changed: `docs/FileMap.md` (1 row removed).
- Tests: `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py -q` — 46 passed.
- Commit: `c063837c`.
- Push: successful to origin/main.
- Cadence: 1/3 since last review.

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/filemap.py`, `docs/FileMap.md`, `tests/test_filemap.py`, `docs/live-build-3.md`.

Task: compared current `origin/main` against FileMap coverage for the Relay decision-record and Session Lifecycle routing work that landed after the previous FileMap pass. Verified `meridian_core/relay.py`, `meridian_core/relay_executor.py`, `tests/test_relay.py`, `tests/test_relay_executor.py`, `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py`, and `tests/test_session_lifecycle.py` are discoverable with accurate V2 purpose text. Found and registered two missing entries (relay_executor.py and test_relay_executor.py).

Completion:

- Build 3 registered relay_executor.py and test_relay_executor.py entries in filemap.py, docs/FileMap.md, and tests/test_filemap.py.
- Files changed: `meridian_core/filemap.py` (2 entries added), `docs/FileMap.md` (2 rows added after relay_dispatch.py), `tests/test_filemap.py` (2 paths added to _REQUIRED_PATHS).

Ready for Codex Review.

## Archived Idle Placeholder

Goal: await next FileMap assignment.

Allowed files only: `docs/live-build-3.md`.

Task: no executable FileMap implementation task is currently assigned. Continue polling and do not create read-check-only commits. If a new V2/V3 doc lands without FileMap coverage, record the gap in the Cross-Check Activity section and wait for Prime/Codex to assign the exact registration slice.

## Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: register the Bifrost balance and prompt payload surface contract in FileMap.

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/filemap.py`, `tests/test_filemap.py`, `docs/live-build-3.md`.

Task: add FileMap coverage for `docs/bifrost-balance-payload-surface-contract.md`, which was created by Build 5 in commit `70d3af4` and cleared by Reviews B with FileMap follow-up.

Requirements:

- Add a concise `FileMapEntry` under the Bifrost area.
- Add the path to `_REQUIRED_PATHS` in `tests/test_filemap.py`.
- Do not edit `docs/bifrost-balance-payload-surface-contract.md`.
- Keep the change mechanical and small.

Tests: `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py -q`.

Completion:

- Coordinator completed this FileMap registration on 2026-05-31.
- Files changed: `meridian_core/filemap.py`, `tests/test_filemap.py`, `docs/live-build-3.md`.
- Tests run: `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py -q` (46 passed).
- Commit: `e9c6824`.

Ready for Codex Review.

## Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: register the active Bifrost V2 cockpit/JARVIS source docs in FileMap.

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/filemap.py`, `docs/FileMap.md`, `tests/test_filemap.py`, `docs/live-build-3.md`.

Task: add FileMap coverage for the active Bifrost V2 UI direction documents:

- `docs/bifrost-v2-cockpit-extensions.md`
- `docs/jarvis-ui-source-assessment.md`

Requirements:

- Keep the registration mechanical and small.
- Add concise Bifrost-area entries in `make_default_map()` and mirror them in `docs/FileMap.md`.
- Add both paths to required-path coverage in `tests/test_filemap.py`.
- Do not edit the Bifrost docs themselves, runtime cockpit code, CSS, or tests outside FileMap coverage.
- Preserve the distinction that these are source/contract docs, not proof of completed runtime UI implementation.

Tests:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py -q`

Completion:

- Coordinator completed this FileMap registration on 2026-05-31.
- Files changed: `meridian_core/filemap.py`, `docs/FileMap.md`, `tests/test_filemap.py`, `docs/live-build-3.md`.
- Tests run: `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py -q`.
- Commit: `d496472`.

Ready for Codex Review.

## Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: register the next completed V2 checklist/benchmark docs in FileMap after they land.

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/filemap.py`, `docs/FileMap.md`, `tests/test_filemap.py`, `docs/live-build-3.md`.

Task: when Build 2 and/or Build 4 complete their current docs, register only the files that exist and are not already discoverable:

- `docs/session-lifecycle-implementation-checklist.md`
- `docs/workflow-subagent-usage-checklist.md`
- `docs/deepseek-validation-benchmark-plan.md`

Requirements:

- Do not create the docs; only register completed docs after they exist.
- Keep the registration mechanical and small.
- Add required-path coverage for each registered file.
- If none of the files exist when this candidate is promoted, stop and report that there is no valid FileMap target instead of inventing placeholder work.

Tests:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py -q`

Completion:

- Coordinator registered the completed workflow usage checklist on 2026-05-31.
- Registered file: `docs/workflow-subagent-usage-checklist.md`.
- Files changed: `meridian_core/filemap.py`, `docs/FileMap.md`, `tests/test_filemap.py`, `docs/live-build-3.md`.
- Tests run: `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py -q`.
- Commit: `a9d6a33`.

Ready for Codex Review.

## Archived Prior Candidate - Promoted Above

Goal: register the next completed V2 checklist/benchmark docs in FileMap after they land.

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/filemap.py`, `docs/FileMap.md`, `tests/test_filemap.py`, `docs/live-build-3.md`.

Task: when Build 2 and/or Build 4 complete the remaining docs, register only the files that exist and are not already discoverable:

- `docs/session-lifecycle-implementation-checklist.md`
- `docs/deepseek-validation-benchmark-plan.md`

Requirements:

- Do not create the docs; only register completed docs after they exist.
- Keep the registration mechanical and small.
- Add required-path coverage for each registered file.
- If neither file exists when this candidate is promoted, stop and report that there is no valid FileMap target instead of inventing placeholder work.

Tests:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py -q`

This file is the standing assignment queue for Build 3.

When idle, check this file every 30 seconds. If there is an active task below, execute it. If the task is complete, commit and push your slice, update Obsidian, then report completion in your session and return to polling this file.

Rules:

- This session must behave as a live worker, not a one-shot handoff. After completing a task, return to this file and keep polling every 30 seconds.
- Before editing any task file, verify you are in your own unique worktree. If you are in `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian` main worktree or sharing a worktree with another lane, stop and report the worktree violation instead of editing.
- If there is no Active Task, do not stop. Append a Read Checks entry, wait 30 seconds, pull latest, and check again.
- Always pull latest `origin/main` before editing.
- Every time you check/read this file, add a timestamped entry to the Read Checks section.
- Every time you modify this file or complete a task from it, add a timestamped entry to the Write/Completion Log section.
- Every minute while idle, check for cross-check activity relevant to your slice: review notes, Codex findings, Aegis findings, failing tests, or Obsidian build log updates.
- If cross-check activity affects your task, record it in this file's Cross-Check Activity section and address it before starting unrelated work.
- After completing a task, mark the slice `Ready for Codex Review` with commit hash, files changed, and tests run.
- Do not perform your own Codex review. A separate Codex Reviews lane owns independent review, findings, and repair routing.
- If the Codex Reviews lane writes a repair task into this file, complete that repair before taking unrelated work.
- After every three completed task-changing commits, pause normal build work until the Codex Reviews lane records a cadence review result.
- Use local time with timezone when possible.
- Own only the files listed in the active task.
- Do not edit Build 1 or Build 2 live queue files.
- Do not edit files owned by another active build task.
- Keep scope tight.
- Run the requested tests.
- Commit only your slice.
- Push to `origin/main`.
- Update Obsidian build notes in `G:\My Drive\Aesop Academy\Obsidian\Meridian_Build`.
- Mark completed slices `Ready for Codex Review` in this file. Include commit hash, files changed, and tests run so `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` can clear or route repairs.

## Codex Review Cadence

After every three completed changes/commits by Build 3, request a Codex review check before starting another task. The review check should automatically repair actionable findings in Build 3-owned files, rerun tests, commit/push fixes, and report the result here.

## Archived Prior Active Task - Do Not Execute

Archived Completed Task:

Coordinator Override task completed in commit `67a75dc`: Registered V1 Electron cockpit app shell (package.json, electron/main.js), Bifrost preview renderer (bifrost/preview.py, tests/test_bifrost_preview.py), and Prime queue reconciliation requirement (docs/prime-queue-reconciliation-requirement.md) in FileMap. All 5 entries now present with FileArea.BIFROST and FileArea.ARCHITECTURE classifications. Tests: 46/46 filemap passing. Ready for Codex Review.

Archived: awaiting new assignment at time of archival.

Prior stale task archived below.

Archived Stale Task:

Goal: register the V2 detailed build plan in FileMap.

Context:

- Codex coordinator completed the V2 detailed build plan in commit `71b8d5f`.
- `docs/v2-detailed-build-plan.md` is a new architecture/build-planning document and is not yet registered in FileMap.
- Build 3 owns FileMap registration.
- The previous Prime cockpit provider FileMap task is already complete: `meridian_core/cockpit_provider.py` and `tests/test_cockpit_provider.py` are present in `docs/FileMap.md`, `meridian_core/filemap.py`, and `_REQUIRED_PATHS`.

Allowed files only:

- `docs/FileMap.md`
- `meridian_core/filemap.py`
- `tests/test_filemap.py`
- `docs/live-build-3.md`

Task:

- Add FileMap coverage for:
  - `docs/v2-detailed-build-plan.md`
- Use the established architecture/build-planning taxonomy near `docs/v2-horizon-plan.md`, `docs/v1-capability-plan.md`, and `docs/v3-parking-lot.md`.
- Add required-path coverage in `tests/test_filemap.py`.
- Do not edit the V2 plan content.

Tests:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py -q`

Completion:

- Commit only this FileMap slice.
- Push to `origin/main`.
- Update Obsidian in `G:\My Drive\Aesop Academy\Obsidian\Meridian_Build`.
- Mark this slice `Ready for Codex Review` with commit hash, files changed, and tests run.

Poll every 30 seconds. When a new task is written here, begin immediately.

Last completed: Prime cockpit provider FileMap registration was already present and review-repaired; next active assignment is the V2 detailed build plan FileMap entry.
