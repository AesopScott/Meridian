## Active Task

Goal: create a Relay Prompt Metrics integration brief.

Allowed files only:

- How to measure prompt construction time.
- How to record prompt token count.
- How to measure time to first token and total response time.
- How to compare against native/vendor baseline when available.
- How Prompt Metrics should interact with Prompt Budget.
- How `HEALTHY` / `WATCH` / `DEGRADED` should affect Prime decisions.
- What should appear in Review Console versus stay internal.
- What must not be inserted into worker prompts.
- Required tests before runtime integration.
