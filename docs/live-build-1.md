# Live Build 1 Queue

This file is the standing assignment queue for Build 1.

When idle, check this file every 30 seconds. If there is an active task below, execute it. If the task is complete, commit and push your slice, update Obsidian, then report completion in your session and return to polling this file.

Rules:

- This session must behave as a live worker, not a one-shot handoff. After completing a task, return to this file and keep polling every 30 seconds.
- If there is no Active Task, do not stop. Append a Read Checks entry, wait 30 seconds, pull latest, and check again.
- Always pull latest `origin/main` before editing.
- Add a timestamped Read Checks entry approximately every 10 minutes while idle, or immediately on any status change. Polling continues every 30 seconds between log entries.
- Every time you modify this file or complete a task from it, add a timestamped entry to the Write/Completion Log section.
- Every minute while idle, check for cross-check activity relevant to your slice: review notes, Codex findings, Aegis findings, failing tests, or Obsidian build log updates.
- If cross-check activity affects your task, record it in this file's Cross-Check Activity section and address it before starting unrelated work.
- After completing a task, mark the slice `Ready for Codex Review` with commit hash, files changed, and tests run.
- Do not perform your own Codex review. A separate Codex Reviews lane owns independent review, findings, and repair routing.
- If the Codex Reviews lane writes a repair task into this file, complete that repair before taking unrelated work.
- After every three completed task-changing commits, pause normal build work until the Codex Reviews lane records a cadence review result.
- Use local time with timezone when possible.
- Own only the files listed in the active task.
- Do not edit Build 2 or Build 3 live queue files.
- Do not edit files owned by another active build task.
- Keep scope tight.
- Run the requested tests.
- Commit only your slice.
- Push to `origin/main`.
- Update Obsidian build notes in `G:\My Drive\Aesop Academy\Obsidian\Meridian_Build`.
- Mark completed slices `Ready for Codex Review` in this file. Include commit hash, files changed, and tests run so `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` can clear or route repairs.

## Read Checks

Append entries here when this file is checked (approximately every 10 minutes while idle, or on status change).

## Cross-Check Activity

Append entries here when you check or act on cross-check activity.

```text
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 1 cross-check: none/finding/fix; details: <short note>
2026-05-30 10:39 -06:00 - Build 1 cross-check finding: PromptBudgetPlan is frozen but allowed_sources is mutable list; repair before Prompt Packet runtime work.
2026-05-30 10:54 -06:00 - Build 1 cross-check: no blocking findings in commit 305b8d4; targeted tests 239 passed.
2026-05-30 11:00 -06:00 - Build 1 cross-check finding: PromptPacket validates through build_prompt_packet(), but direct PromptPacket(...) construction can bypass validation.
2026-05-31 ~03:10 CDT - Build 1 cross-check: Codex Reviews lane has active sweep; Build 1 slices 6af04d4 and fd35a81 pending review; no repair task routed yet.
2026-05-31 ~04:35 CDT - Build 1 cross-check: parallel Build 1 session has already created meridian_core/lane_state.py and tests/test_lane_state.py (untracked, mtime within minutes); 37/37 lane_state tests pass; deferring slice commit to that session to avoid same-file race; this session logs heartbeat only.
2026-05-31 ~16:55 CDT - Build 1 cross-check: parallel Build 1 session has already created meridian_core/relay_executor.py and tests/test_relay_executor.py (untracked, mtime within minutes); 26/26 relay_executor tests pass; deferring slice commit to active worker session.

## Codex Review Cadence

After every three completed changes/commits by Build 1, request a Codex review check before starting another task. The review check should automatically repair actionable findings in Build 1-owned files, rerun tests, commit/push fixes, and report the result here.

```text
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 1 Codex review requested after commits <hash1>, <hash2>, <hash3>
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 1 Codex review finding: <severity>; details: <short note>
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 1 Codex review repair: commit <hash>; tests <result>; details: <short note>
