# Live Build 1 Queue

This file is the standing assignment queue for Build 1.

When idle, check this file every 30 seconds. If there is an active task below, execute it. If the task is complete, commit and push your slice, update Obsidian, then report completion in your session and return to polling this file.

Rules:

- This session must behave as a live worker, not a one-shot handoff. After completing a task, return to this file and keep polling every 30 seconds.
- If there is no Active Task, do not stop. Append a Read Checks entry, wait 30 seconds, pull latest, and check again.
- Always pull latest `origin/main` before editing.
- Every time you check/read this file, add a timestamped entry to the Read Checks section.
- Every time you modify this file or complete a task from it, add a timestamped entry to the Write/Completion Log section.
- Every minute while idle, check for cross-check activity relevant to your slice: review notes, Codex findings, Aegis findings, failing tests, or Obsidian build log updates.
- If cross-check activity affects your task, record it in this file's Cross-Check Activity section and address it before starting unrelated work.
- After every three completed changes/commits from this build session, stop normal build work and request a Codex review check before taking another build task.
- The Codex review check must automatically repair actionable findings in your owned files, rerun required tests, commit/push the repair slice, and report findings/fixes back in this file's heartbeat sections.
- Record Codex review requests, findings, repairs, and outcomes in the Codex Review Cadence section.
- Use local time with timezone when possible.
- Own only the files listed in the active task.
- Do not edit Build 2 or Build 3 live queue files.
- Do not edit files owned by another active build task.
- Keep scope tight.
- Run the requested tests.
- Commit only your slice.
- Push to `origin/main`.
- Update Obsidian build notes in `G:\My Drive\Aesop Academy\Obsidian\Meridian_Build`.

## Cross-Check Activity

Append entries here when you check or act on cross-check activity.

```text
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 1 cross-check: none/finding/fix; details: <short note>
2026-05-30 10:39 -06:00 - Build 1 cross-check finding: PromptBudgetPlan is frozen but allowed_sources is mutable list; repair before Prompt Packet runtime work.
2026-05-30 10:54 -06:00 - Build 1 cross-check: no blocking findings in commit 305b8d4; targeted tests 239 passed.
2026-05-30 11:00 -06:00 - Build 1 cross-check finding: PromptPacket validates through build_prompt_packet(), but direct PromptPacket(...) construction can bypass validation.
```

## Codex Review Cadence

After every three completed changes/commits by Build 1, request a Codex review check before starting another task. The review check should automatically repair actionable findings in Build 1-owned files, rerun tests, commit/push fixes, and report the result here.

```text
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 1 Codex review requested after commits <hash1>, <hash2>, <hash3>
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 1 Codex review finding: <severity>; details: <short note>
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 1 Codex review repair: commit <hash>; tests <result>; details: <short note>
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 1 Codex review result: pass/no actionable findings/fixed; details: <short note>
```

## Active Task

Goal: add a PromptPacket model-dispatch boundary.

Allowed files only:

- `meridian_core/prompt_packet.py`
- `tests/test_prompt_packet.py`

Task:

- Build 1 completed PromptPacket construction hardening in commit `0ce0cf9`.
- Next, make the "only serialized_prompt goes to the model" rule executable.
- Add a tiny method or helper that returns the model-facing prompt payload from a `PromptPacket`.
- The returned value must contain only the serialized prompt text, not packet id, budget, source lineage, construction time, or metrics metadata.
- Keep this domain-only.
- Do not edit Relay yet.
- Do not edit package exports; Build 2 owns package API.
- Do not edit FileMap; Build 3 owns FileMap.
- No UI.
- No persistence.
- No model calls.
- Add tests proving:
  - the model-dispatch boundary returns exactly the serialized prompt
  - packet metadata is not present in the returned payload
  - existing validation and immutability behavior still works

Tests:

```text
python -m pytest tests/test_prompt_packet.py -q
python -m pytest -q
```

Completion:

- Commit only this slice.
- Push to `origin/main`.
- Update Obsidian.
- Report commit hash and test count in your session.
