# Live Build 1 Queue

This file is the standing assignment queue for Build 1.

When idle, check this file every 30 seconds. If there is an active task below, execute it. If the task is complete, commit and push your slice, update Obsidian, then report completion in your session and return to polling this file.

Rules:

- This session must behave as a live worker, not a one-shot handoff. After completing a task, return to this file and keep polling every 30 seconds.
- If there is no Active Task, do not stop. Append a Read Checks entry, wait 30 seconds, pull latest, and check again.
- Always pull latest `origin/main` before editing.
- Every time you check/read this file, add a timestamped entry to the Read Checks section.
- Every time you modify this file or complete a task from it, add a timestamped entry to the Write/Completion Log section.
- Every minute while idle, check for cross-check activity relevant to your slice: review notes, Codex findings, Aegis findings, failing tests, or Obsidian build log updates.
- If cross-check activity affects your task, record it in this file's Cross-Check Activity section and address it before starting unrelated work.
- After completing a task, mark the slice `Ready for Codex Review` with commit hash, files changed, and tests run.
- Do not perform your own Codex review. A separate Codex Reviews lane owns independent review, findings, and repair routing.
- If the Codex Reviews lane writes a repair task into this file, complete that repair before taking unrelated work.
- After every three completed task-changing commits, pause normal build work until the Codex Reviews lane records a cadence review result.
- Use local time with timezone when possible.
- Own only the files listed in the active task.
- Do not edit Build 2 or Build 3 live queue files.
- Do not edit files owned by another active build task.
- Keep scope tight.
- Run the requested tests.
- Commit only your slice.
- Push to `origin/main`.
- Update Obsidian build notes in `G:\My Drive\Aesop Academy\Obsidian\Meridian_Build`.
- Mark completed slices `Ready for Codex Review` in this file. Include commit hash, files changed, and tests run so `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` can clear or route repairs.

## Cross-Check Activity

Append entries here when you check or act on cross-check activity.

```text
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 1 cross-check: none/finding/fix; details: <short note>
2026-05-30 10:39 -06:00 - Build 1 cross-check finding: PromptBudgetPlan is frozen but allowed_sources is mutable list; repair before Prompt Packet runtime work.
2026-05-30 10:54 -06:00 - Build 1 cross-check: no blocking findings in commit 305b8d4; targeted tests 239 passed.
2026-05-30 11:00 -06:00 - Build 1 cross-check finding: PromptPacket validates through build_prompt_packet(), but direct PromptPacket(...) construction can bypass validation.
2026-05-31 ~03:10 CDT - Build 1 cross-check: Codex Reviews lane has active sweep; Build 1 slices 6af04d4 and fd35a81 pending review; no repair task routed yet.
2026-05-31 ~04:35 CDT - Build 1 cross-check: parallel Build 1 session has already created meridian_core/lane_state.py and tests/test_lane_state.py (untracked, mtime within minutes); 37/37 lane_state tests pass; deferring slice commit to that session to avoid same-file race; this session logs heartbeat only.
2026-05-31 ~16:55 CDT - Build 1 cross-check: parallel Build 1 session has already created meridian_core/relay_executor.py and tests/test_relay_executor.py (untracked, mtime within minutes); 26/26 relay_executor tests pass; deferring slice commit to active worker session.
```

## Codex Review Cadence

After every three completed changes/commits by Build 1, request a Codex review check before starting another task. The review check should automatically repair actionable findings in Build 1-owned files, rerun tests, commit/push fixes, and report the result here.

```text
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 1 Codex review requested after commits <hash1>, <hash2>, <hash3>
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 1 Codex review finding: <severity>; details: <short note>
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 1 Codex review repair: commit <hash>; tests <result>; details: <short note>
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 1 Codex review result: pass/no actionable findings/fixed; details: <short note>
2026-05-31 ~00:40 CDT - Build 1 Codex review requested after commits b453e2e, 0ce0cf9, 111a975

2026-05-31 ~00:40 CDT - Build 1 Codex review repair: commit 9389563; tests 688 passed; strip() check + packet_id validation added

## Active Task

Current Active Task (supersedes any stale idle text below):

[COMPLETED 2026-05-31 ~17:05 CDT] V0 Relay executor skeleton — commit 190e527; 811 tests pass. Slice ready for Codex Review.

Goal: build the V0 Relay executor skeleton.

Context:

- Build 1 commit `d2820d2` is still awaiting Review A, but that is not a stop sign under the three-slice cadence rule.
- This slice should create the provider-neutral execution boundary without calling real Claude, OpenAI, OpenRouter, shell, or account-based automation.

Allowed files only:

- `meridian_core/relay_executor.py`
- `tests/test_relay_executor.py`
- `docs/live-build-1.md`

Task:

- Add a small Relay executor domain slice that can execute a `RelayDispatchPlan` through an injected model-call function.
- Include:
  - `RelayExecutionResult`
  - `RelayExecutionError`
  - a callable/protocol boundary that accepts only the lane payload and returns text
  - `execute_relay_dispatch_plan(plan, model_call)`
- Preserve the Relay prompt-efficiency constraint: only the lane payload should be passed to the model-call function unless a test proves otherwise.
- Do not call external APIs.
- Do not add vendor-specific model code.
- Do not edit package exports unless Build 2 has already exposed the needed symbol and this file requires a tiny follow-up; if so, stop and record the need instead of editing outside your lane.

Tests:

- Add focused tests for:
  - empty dispatch plan returns empty result collection
  - one model-call per lane
  - returned text captured per lane
  - exception converted into execution error
  - metadata is not passed into the model-call function
- Run `python -m pytest tests/test_relay_executor.py -q`.
- Also run the existing Relay dispatch/packet tests if practical.

Completion:

- Commit only this slice.
- Push to `origin/main`.
- Update Obsidian.
- Mark this slice `Ready for Codex Review` with commit hash, files changed, and tests run.

Stale prior text follows.

No active task. Build 1 is idle — slice d2820d2 marked Ready for Codex Review; awaiting review result or next assignment.
