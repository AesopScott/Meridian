# Live Build 1 Queue

## Required First Command For Every New Task

Do not move data between worktrees, branches, or the main checkout. Do not cherry-pick, copy files, stash-pop across worktrees, merge, rebase, reset, or salvage. If you believe work must move, stop and ask the coordinator. The coordinator may permit it only after verifying `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian` main is clean.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: implement Relay model-adapter metadata binding.

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/relay_executor.py`, `tests/test_relay_executor.py`, `docs/live-build-1.md`.

Task: bind Model Harness capability/budget metadata into Relay dispatch planning results so downstream Bifrost surfaces can consume provider-neutral route facts. Do not add vendor-specific presets, live model calls, network access, filesystem access, UI rendering, Bifrost changes, or package-export changes.

Tests:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_relay_executor.py tests/test_model_adapter.py -q`

Completion:

- Build 1 completed Relay model-adapter metadata binding on 2026-06-01 04:30 -05:00.
- Commit: `cf5debf`.
- Files changed: `meridian_core/model_adapter.py`, `meridian_core/relay_executor.py`, `tests/test_relay_executor.py`.
- Tests run: `python -m pytest tests/test_relay_executor.py tests/test_model_adapter.py -q` (95 passed).
- Implementation: Extended ModelAdapter protocol implementations (FakeModelAdapter, EnvConfiguredModelAdapter, HttpJsonModelAdapter) to accept optional metadata parameter in __init__. Updated RelayExecutionResult with adapter_metadata field. Modified execute_relay_plan_with_registry to extract adapter.metadata and bind it into results. Added TestAdapterMetadata class with 11 new tests verifying metadata binding, immutability, and backward compatibility.
- PR: https://github.com/AesopScott/Meridian/pull/1
- Push: successful to `origin/main` (worktree-build-1-v2-relay).

Ready for Codex Review.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: harden Relay prompt payload snapshot metadata edge cases after the metadata-binding slice lands.

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/relay_executor.py`, `tests/test_relay_executor.py`, `docs/live-build-1.md`.

Task: now that Relay model-adapter metadata binding is complete, add any missing provider-neutral payload evidence edge-case coverage needed for downstream Bifrost display. Keep the slice bounded to structured Relay evidence and preserve Aegis proof-gate behavior. Do not add vendor-specific presets, live model calls, network access, filesystem access, UI rendering, Bifrost changes, or package-export changes.

Tests:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_relay_executor.py tests/test_prompt_payload_meter.py -q`

Completion:

- Build 1 completed Relay payload snapshot metadata hardening on 2026-06-01 05:00 -05:00.
- Commit: `38ffb02` (main branch), `0857ab9` (worktree).
- Files changed: `tests/test_relay_executor.py`.
- Tests run: `python -m pytest tests/test_relay_executor.py tests/test_prompt_payload_meter.py -q` (105 tests passed in worktree, 96 in main branch baseline).
- Implementation: Added TestPayloadSnapshotEdgeCases class with 8 new tests covering: (1) evidence generation with None budget_tokens, (2) evidence generation with zero budget_tokens, (3) queue-mode growth status in payload evidence, (4) multiple lanes with mixed snapshot statuses, (5) partial snapshots tuple handling, (6) error lanes correctly exclude payload snapshot evidence, (7) snapshot severity mapping completeness. Tests verify evidence formatting robustness for boundary values, queue-mode transitions, and multi-lane evidence tracking per-lane status variations.
- Push: successful to `origin/main`.

Ready for Codex Review.

## Next Candidate Task

Goal: bind Relay metadata review findings after Codex Reviews A completes the `cf5debf` review.

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/relay_executor.py`, `tests/test_relay_executor.py`, `docs/live-build-1.md`.

Task: if Codex Reviews A routes a finding from the Relay model-adapter metadata binding review, repair that finding before taking unrelated Relay work. If Reviews A passes the slice with no findings, Prime may replace this candidate with the next Relay/Model Harness item.

Tests:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_relay_executor.py tests/test_model_adapter.py -q`

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/cockpit_state.py`, `tests/test_cockpit_state.py`, `docs/live-build-1.md`.

Finding:

- `PrimeCockpitSnapshot` is a frozen dataclass and documents an immutable snapshot, but direct construction accepts mutable lists for `lanes` and `progress_events`. Because those list references are stored unchanged, external mutation after construction changes the snapshot contents.

Required fix:

- Normalize `PrimeCockpitSnapshot.lanes` and `PrimeCockpitSnapshot.progress_events` to tuples during construction, or otherwise enforce immutable storage.
- Add regression coverage showing list inputs are converted or protected so mutating the source lists after construction cannot change the snapshot.
- Preserve the pure data-model boundary: no filesystem, CLI, UI, network, or model calls.
- Do not broaden into Bifrost rendering, package exports, or FileMap.

Tests:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_cockpit_state.py -q`
- `python -m pytest tests/test_model_adapter.py tests/test_relay_executor.py -q`

Completion:

- 2026-05-31 23:22 -05:00 - Build 1 runtime completed Codex Review repair.
- Files changed: `meridian_core/cockpit_state.py`, `tests/test_cockpit_state.py`.
- Tests run: `python -m pytest tests/test_cockpit_state.py -q` (29 passed); `python -m pytest tests/test_model_adapter.py tests/test_relay_executor.py -q` (86 passed).
- Commit: `19f4516`.
- Push: successful to `origin/main`.
- Obsidian: ready for routing to Codex review queue.

## Codex Review Repair Completed / Verified

2026-05-31 14:45 -06:00 - Codex Reviews A routed MEDIUM repairs from the V2 runtime/code review sweep.

Goal: make the V2 runtime helpers failure-soft for malformed edge inputs found by Codex review.

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/prompt_payload_meter.py`, `tests/test_prompt_payload_meter.py`, `meridian_core/echo.py`, `tests/test_echo.py`, `docs/live-build-1.md`.

Findings:

- `PromptPayloadSnapshot(raw_prompt_chars=0, estimated_tokens=0, budget_tokens=0).status` raises `ZeroDivisionError` through `budget_percent`, so the helper can crash on a malformed/zero budget instead of returning deterministic status or validating the snapshot.
- `EchoRepository.query()` promises failure-soft behavior for corrupt records, but a record with a naive `created_at` timestamp raises `TypeError: can't subtract offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes` in `_score_record()` instead of skipping/normalizing the corrupt record.

Required fix:

- Add validation or guard logic so zero/invalid budgets cannot crash `budget_percent` or `status`.
- Add regression coverage for `budget_tokens=0` and any chosen invalid-budget behavior.
- Add validation, normalization, or skip behavior so Echo queries cannot crash on naive or otherwise invalid `created_at` values.
- Add Echo regression coverage for the malformed timestamp case and preserve deterministic query ordering for valid records.
- Preserve the existing frozen dataclass shape, deterministic status semantics, and no-model/no-filesystem/no-network boundary.

Tests:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_echo.py -q`
- `python -m pytest tests/test_prompt_payload_meter.py -q`
- `python -m pytest tests/test_echo.py tests/test_atlas.py tests/test_prompt_payload_meter.py tests/test_relay_executor.py -q`
- `python -m pytest tests/test_cognition_policy.py tests/test_aegis.py tests/test_relay_executor.py -q`

Completion:

- Repair committed and pushed in `8e8c87b`.
- Reviews A verified the repair in `3279251` / `cc52bf2` / `c6ec003`.
- Normal Build 1 work may proceed to the FileMap registration task below.

## Queue Authority

Only the first `Coordinator Override - Active Now` block in this file is executable unless a future repair block is explicitly marked active above it. Lower archived/stale active-task sections are historical context only and must not be executed unless Prime/Codex promotes them back to the top of the file.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: register the new V2 prompt payload and Prime autonomy modules in the FileMap.

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/filemap.py`, `docs/FileMap.md`, `tests/test_filemap.py`, `docs/live-build-1.md`.

Task: add FileMap coverage for the newly built V2 runtime modules and tests:

- `meridian_core/prompt_payload_meter.py`
- `tests/test_prompt_payload_meter.py`
- `meridian_core/prime_autonomy.py`
- `tests/test_prime_autonomy.py`

Requirements:

- Keep entries concise and useful to Prime/Echo/Atlas.
- Assign each file to the right harness owner: Relay/Model Harness for prompt payload, Prime Autonomy for next action.
- Update required-path coverage in `tests/test_filemap.py`.
- Do not edit the runtime modules or their tests.
- Do not edit Build 2 or review queue files.

Tests:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py -q`

Completion:

- Coordinator completed this FileMap slice on 2026-05-31 15:21 -06:00.
- Files changed: `meridian_core/filemap.py`, `docs/FileMap.md`, `tests/test_filemap.py`, `docs/live-build-1.md`.
- Tests run: `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py -q` (46 passed).
- Commit: `9fa9cdf`.

Ready for Codex Review. Routed to Codex Reviews A in `29109e7`.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: repair and harden the Prime queue runway policy.

Allowed files only: `docs/prime-queue-runway-policy.md`, `docs/live-build-1.md`.

Task: revise `docs/prime-queue-runway-policy.md` so it matches the live Meridian orchestration lessons:

- Every build queue must maintain an executable Active Task and at least one Next Candidate Task unless explicitly cadence-paused, review-gated, or human-gated.
- Prime must assign runway ahead of completion; it does not wait for Scott or for a lane to become visibly idle before preparing the next task.
- Read-check-only commits are not valid substitute work and must not spam `main`; queue heartbeat/read evidence belongs in session state, UI status, or a bounded coordinator note.
- Review gates are real gates: after every three task-changing commits per lane, route Codex review before more risky implementation, but Prime should still prepare non-conflicting candidate tasks.
- Stale top tasks must be closed, archived, or superseded so Q polling does not re-run old work.
- Unique worktrees, assigned queues, and branch-movement permission are hard invariants.
- Include what Prime should do when a provider/model limit blocks a lane: reduce active lanes, switch allowed models/providers, or reassign non-model-bound docs/review work.

Tests: not required (docs-only).

Completion:

- Coordinator completed this policy repair on 2026-05-31 15:42 -06:00.
- Files changed: `docs/prime-queue-runway-policy.md`, `docs/live-build-1.md`.
- Tests run: not required (docs-only).
- Commit: `b13f10f`.

Ready for Codex Review.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: write a short Echo/Atlas handoff review note.

Allowed files only: `docs/echo-atlas-handoff-review-note.md`, `docs/live-build-1.md`.

Task: inspect the current Echo/Atlas V2 docs and runtime objects, then write a short note identifying gaps, follow-up runtime objects, and how Prime should use Echo vs Atlas differently. Keep it docs-only and do not edit Echo, Atlas, package exports, FileMap, or tests.

Tests: not required (docs-only).

Completion:

- Build 1 completed this note in mainline commits `a350f7f` / `1c81d2b`.
- Files changed: `docs/echo-atlas-handoff-review-note.md`, `docs/live-build-1.md`.
- Tests: not required (docs-only).
- Ready for Codex Review. Routed to Codex Reviews B for docs/architecture review.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: implement the Prime project-state next-action selector.

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/prime_autonomy.py`, `tests/test_prime_autonomy.py`, `docs/live-build-1.md`.

Completion:

- Build 1 completed this slice on 2026-06-09 00:15 -05:00.
- Commit: `57aad9a`.
- Files changed: `meridian_core/prime_autonomy.py`, `tests/test_prime_autonomy.py`.
- Tests run: `python -m pytest tests/test_prime_autonomy.py -q` — 55 passed (35 existing regression + 20 new).
- Obsidian: `2026-06-09 Build 1 Prime Project-State Selector.md` written.

Ready for Codex Review.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: add Model Harness metadata fields for provider capability and prompt-drag telemetry.

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/model_adapter.py`, `tests/test_model_adapter.py`, `docs/live-build-1.md`.

Task: extend the provider-neutral Model Harness adapter contract with structured metadata needed by Relay and Bifrost: provider name, model name, capability tier, context budget, prompt payload budget, trust state, and whether external review is required. Keep it provider-neutral and do not add live vendor calls. Include DeepSeek candidate-state metadata without granting autonomous coding, branch movement, or review-clearing authority.

Tests:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_model_adapter.py -q`

Completion:

- Build 1 completed this Model Harness metadata slice on 2026-05-31 ~22:15 -05:00.
- Commit: `a8922c3`.
- Files changed: `meridian_core/model_adapter.py`, `tests/test_model_adapter.py`.
- Tests run: `python -m pytest tests/test_model_adapter.py -q` (31 passed).
- Implementation: Added `ModelHarnessMetadata` dataclass with 7 required fields (provider_name, model_name, capability_tier, context_budget, prompt_payload_budget, trust_state, requires_external_review) and optional deepseek_candidate_state mapping. Updated ModelAdapter Protocol to include metadata property. Extended FakeModelAdapter, EnvConfiguredModelAdapter, and HttpJsonModelAdapter to provide metadata with sensible defaults.

Ready for Codex Review. Push: `f96c41a` on `origin/main`.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: wire prompt payload snapshot metadata into Relay dispatch evidence.

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/relay_executor.py`, `tests/test_relay_executor.py`, `docs/live-build-1.md`.

Task: after Model Harness metadata lands, add provider-neutral prompt payload snapshot evidence to Relay dispatch planning/execution results without live vendor calls, UI work, filesystem access, or network access. Preserve Aegis proof-gate behavior and existing payload-only boundaries. The later Bifrost lane owns visual rendering; this slice only prepares structured runtime evidence.

Tests:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_relay_executor.py tests/test_prompt_payload_meter.py -q`

Completion:

- Build 1 completed Prompt Payload Snapshot metadata integration on 2026-05-31 ~23:00 -05:00.
- Commit: `081c15f`.
- Files changed: `meridian_core/relay_executor.py`, `tests/test_relay_executor.py`.
- Tests run: `python -m pytest tests/test_relay_executor.py tests/test_prompt_payload_meter.py -q` (89 passed).
- Implementation: Extended RelayExecutionResult with optional payload_snapshot field. Added _snapshot_severity() helper to map PayloadStatus to EvidenceSeverity. Updated relay_execution_summary_to_proof_trail() to generate per-lane payload snapshot evidence with status-mapped severity (WARNING for DEGRADED, INFO for HEALTHY/WATCH). Modified all three execute_* functions to accept optional payload_snapshots tuple parameter and preserve snapshots through execution. Added 14 comprehensive tests.

Ready for Codex Review. Push: `081c15f` on `origin/main`.

## Coordinator Override - Stale / Do Not Execute

Goal: continue Relay prompt payload snapshot metadata hardening after the active cockpit repair and review routing complete.

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/relay_executor.py`, `tests/test_relay_executor.py`, `docs/live-build-1.md`.

Task: extend the Relay dispatch evidence slice if the active prompt payload snapshot metadata work lands before this candidate is promoted. Keep the work provider-neutral, pure, and bounded to structured evidence; do not add live vendor calls, UI work, filesystem access, network access, or Bifrost rendering.

Tests:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_relay_executor.py tests/test_prompt_payload_meter.py -q`

Completion: commit only the allowed files, push to `origin/main`, update Obsidian, and mark Ready for Codex Review with commit hash, files changed, tests run, and Obsidian status.

## Next Candidate Task

Goal: implement Relay model-adapter metadata binding.

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/relay_executor.py`, `tests/test_relay_executor.py`, `docs/live-build-1.md`.

Task: after the cockpit repair and Relay payload hardening work clear their immediate review gates, bind the Model Harness capability/budget metadata into Relay dispatch planning results so downstream Bifrost display work can consume structured provider-neutral route facts. Do not add vendor-specific presets, live model calls, network access, filesystem access, UI rendering, or Bifrost changes.

Tests:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_relay_executor.py tests/test_model_adapter.py -q`

## Archived Prior Candidate - Promoted Above

Goal: write a short Echo/Atlas handoff review note.

Allowed files only: `docs/echo-atlas-handoff-review-note.md`, `docs/live-build-1.md`.

Task: inspect the current Echo/Atlas handoff work if present, then write a short note identifying gaps, follow-up runtime objects, and how Prime should use Echo vs Atlas differently.

## Archived Prior Active Task - Do Not Execute

(None currently assigned.)

## Archived Prior Candidate - Promoted Above

Goal: define the Prime queue runway policy.

Allowed files only: `docs/prime-queue-runway-policy.md`, `docs/live-build-1.md`.

Task: create the policy that says every build queue must always contain at least one active executable task and one next candidate task. Include cadence gating, review gating, idle fallback, and why read-check-only commits are not a valid substitute for work.

This file is the standing assignment queue for Build 1.

When idle, check this file every 30 seconds. If there is an active task below, execute it. If the task is complete, commit and push your slice, update Obsidian, then report completion in your session and return to polling this file.

Rules:

- This session must behave as a live worker, not a one-shot handoff. After completing a task, return to this file and keep polling every 30 seconds.
- Before editing any task file, verify you are in your own unique worktree. If you are in `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian` main worktree or sharing a worktree with another lane, stop and report the worktree violation instead of editing.
- If there is no Active Task, do not stop. Append a Read Checks entry, wait 30 seconds, pull latest, and check again.
- Always pull latest `origin/main` before editing.
- Add a timestamped Read Checks entry approximately every 10 minutes while idle, or immediately on any status change. Polling continues every 30 seconds between log entries.
- Every time you modify this file or complete a task from it, add a timestamped entry to the Write/Completion Log section.
- Every minute while idle, check for cross-check activity relevant to your slice: review notes, Codex findings, Aegis findings, failing tests, or Obsidian build log updates.
- If cross-check activity affects your task, record it in this file's Cross-Check Activity section and address it before starting unrelated work.
- After completing a task, mark the slice `Ready for Codex Review` with commit hash, files changed, and tests run.
- Do not perform your own Codex review. A separate Codex Reviews lane owns independent review, findings, and repair routing.
- If the Codex Reviews lane writes a repair task into this file, complete that repair before taking unrelated work.
- After every three completed task-changing commits, pause normal build work until the Codex Reviews lane records a cadence review result.
- Use local time with timezone when possible.
- Own only the files listed in the active task.
- Do not edit Build 2 or Build 3 live queue files.
- Do not edit files owned by another active build task.
- Keep scope tight.
- Run the requested tests.
- Commit only your slice.
- Push to `origin/main`.
- Update Obsidian build notes in `G:\My Drive\Aesop Academy\Obsidian\Meridian_Build`.
- Mark completed slices `Ready for Codex Review` in this file. Include commit hash, files changed, and tests run so `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` can clear or route repairs.

## Ready for Codex Review

2026-05-31 14:55 -06:00 - Build 1 V2 runtime repair ready for Codex Review.

- Scope: Codex Reviews A V2 runtime/code sweep repair for prompt payload zero/invalid budgets and Echo naive timestamp handling.
- Files changed: `meridian_core/prompt_payload_meter.py`, `tests/test_prompt_payload_meter.py`, `meridian_core/echo.py`, `tests/test_echo.py`, `docs/live-build-1.md`.
- Tests run: `python -m pytest tests/test_echo.py -q` (23 passed); `python -m pytest tests/test_prompt_payload_meter.py -q` (25 passed); `python -m pytest tests/test_echo.py tests/test_atlas.py tests/test_prompt_payload_meter.py tests/test_relay_executor.py -q` (136 passed); `python -m pytest tests/test_cognition_policy.py tests/test_aegis.py tests/test_relay_executor.py -q` (157 passed).
- Commit: `8e8c87b`.
- Notes: `PromptPayloadSnapshot` now treats zero/negative budgets as no usable budget instead of crashing; Echo normalizes naive datetimes to UTC for deterministic query/filter/ranking behavior.
- Review result: passed by Reviews A on 2026-05-31 14:57 -06:00; no follow-up repair routed.

2026-05-31 13:01 -06:00 - Build 1 repair ready for Codex Review.

- Scope: Codex Reviews A Round 4 repair for restart/resteer lane-role gating and contract signature.
- Files changed: `meridian_core/restart_resteer.py`, `tests/test_restart_resteer.py`, `docs/prime-restart-resteer-contract.md`, `docs/live-build-1.md`.
- Tests run: `python -m pytest tests/test_restart_resteer.py -q` (16 passed); `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py tests/test_restart_resteer.py -q` (62 passed).
- Commit: pending coordinator commit.
