# Live Build 1 Queue

This file is the standing assignment queue for Build 1.

When idle, check this file every 30 seconds. If there is an active task below, execute it. If the task is complete, commit and push your slice, update Obsidian, then report completion in your session and return to polling this file.

Rules:

- This session must behave as a live worker, not a one-shot handoff. After completing a task, return to this file and keep polling every 30 seconds.
- If there is no Active Task, do not stop. Append a Read Checks entry, wait 30 seconds, pull latest, and check again.
- Always pull latest `origin/main` before editing.
- Every time you check/read this file, add a timestamped entry to the Read Checks section.
- Every time you modify this file or complete a task from it, add a timestamped entry to the Write/Completion Log section.
- Every minute while idle, check for cross-check activity relevant to your slice: review notes, Codex findings, Aegis findings, failing tests, or Obsidian build log updates.
- If cross-check activity affects your task, record it in this file's Cross-Check Activity section and address it before starting unrelated work.
- After every three completed changes/commits from this build session, stop normal build work and request a Codex review check before taking another build task.
- The Codex review check must automatically repair actionable findings in your owned files, rerun required tests, commit/push the repair slice, and report findings/fixes back in this file's heartbeat sections.
- Record Codex review requests, findings, repairs, and outcomes in the Codex Review Cadence section.
- Use local time with timezone when possible.
- Own only the files listed in the active task.
- Do not edit Build 2 or Build 3 live queue files.
- Do not edit files owned by another active build task.
- Keep scope tight.
- Run the requested tests.
- Commit only your slice.
- Push to `origin/main`.
- Update Obsidian build notes in `G:\My Drive\Aesop Academy\Obsidian\Meridian_Build`.

## Cross-Check Activity

Append entries here when you check or act on cross-check activity.

```text
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 1 cross-check: none/finding/fix; details: <short note>
2026-05-30 10:39 -06:00 - Build 1 cross-check finding: PromptBudgetPlan is frozen but allowed_sources is mutable list; repair before Prompt Packet runtime work.
2026-05-30 10:54 -06:00 - Build 1 cross-check: no blocking findings in commit 305b8d4; targeted tests 239 passed.
2026-05-30 11:00 -06:00 - Build 1 cross-check finding: PromptPacket validates through build_prompt_packet(), but direct PromptPacket(...) construction can bypass validation.
```

## Codex Review Cadence

After every three completed changes/commits by Build 1, request a Codex review check before starting another task. The review check should automatically repair actionable findings in Build 1-owned files, rerun tests, commit/push fixes, and report the result here.

```text
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 1 Codex review requested after commits <hash1>, <hash2>, <hash3>
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 1 Codex review finding: <severity>; details: <short note>
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 1 Codex review repair: commit <hash>; tests <result>; details: <short note>
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 1 Codex review result: pass/no actionable findings/fixed; details: <short note>
2026-05-31 ~00:40 CDT - Build 1 Codex review requested after commits b453e2e, 0ce0cf9, 111a975
2026-05-31 ~00:40 CDT - Build 1 Codex review finding: MEDIUM; whitespace-only prompt passes validation (truthy but blank)
2026-05-31 ~00:40 CDT - Build 1 Codex review finding: MEDIUM; empty packet_id passes without error
2026-05-31 ~00:40 CDT - Build 1 Codex review repair: commit 9389563; tests 688 passed; strip() check + packet_id validation added
2026-05-31 ~00:40 CDT - Build 1 Codex review result: fixed; all other checks clear (no aliasing, no leakage, no budget gaps)
```

## Active Task

Goal: run Build 1 Codex review pass for the PromptPacket slice.

Allowed files only:

- `meridian_core/prompt_packet.py`
- `tests/test_prompt_packet.py`

Task:

- Build 1 has completed three PromptPacket-related commits since the last major review:
  - `b453e2e` Prompt Packet domain model
  - `0ce0cf9` PromptPacket validation hardening
  - `111a975` PromptPacket model_payload() dispatch boundary
- Per the live queue cadence, stop normal build work and perform a Codex-style review pass on the Build 1-owned PromptPacket slice.
- Review only:
  - `meridian_core/prompt_packet.py`
  - `tests/test_prompt_packet.py`
  - related prompt budget assumptions only if needed for correctness
- Look specifically for:
  - invalid direct construction paths
  - mutable metadata or lineage aliasing
  - metadata leakage through `model_payload()`
  - budget validation gaps
  - unclear validation error aggregation
  - missing or weak tests
- Automatically repair actionable findings in the allowed files.
- If there are no actionable findings, record that result in this queue and return to polling.
- Do not edit Relay yet.
- Do not edit package exports; Build 2 owns package API.
- Do not edit FileMap; Build 3 owns FileMap.
- No UI.
- No persistence.
- No model calls.

Tests:

```text
python -m pytest tests/test_prompt_packet.py tests/test_prompt_budget.py -q
python -m pytest -q
```

Completion:

- Commit only this slice.
- Push to `origin/main`.
- Update Obsidian.
- Report commit hash and test count in your session.
