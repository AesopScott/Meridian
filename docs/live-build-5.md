# Live Build 5 Queue

This file is the standing assignment queue for Build 5.

Build 5 is the Bifrost / session-harness product lane. It should work on UI behavior briefs, session queue activation, cockpit interaction contracts, and user-facing workflow design. It should not implement runtime code unless Codex explicitly assigns a code slice later.

When idle, check this file every 30 seconds. If there is an active task below, execute it. If the task is complete, commit and push your slice, update Obsidian, then report completion in your session and return to polling this file.

Rules:

- This session must behave as a live worker, not a one-shot handoff. After completing a task, return to this file and keep polling every 30 seconds.
- If there is no Active Task, do not stop. Append a Read Checks entry, wait 30 seconds, pull latest, and check again.
- Always pull latest `origin/main` before editing.
- Every time you check/read this file, add a timestamped entry to the Read Checks section.
- Every time you modify this file or complete a task from it, add a timestamped entry to the Write/Completion Log section.
- Every minute while idle, check for cross-check activity relevant to your slice: review notes, Codex findings, Aegis findings, failing tests, or Obsidian build log updates.
- If cross-check activity affects your task, record it in this file's Cross-Check Activity section and address it before starting unrelated work.
- After completing a task, mark the slice `Ready for Codex Review` with commit hash, files changed, and tests run.
- Do not perform your own Codex review. A separate Codex Reviews lane owns independent review, findings, and repair routing.
- If the Codex Reviews lane writes a repair task into this file, complete that repair before taking unrelated work.
- After every three completed task-changing commits, pause normal build work until the Codex Reviews lane records a cadence review result.
- Use local time with timezone when possible.
- Own only the files listed in the active task.
- Do not edit Build 1, Build 2, Build 3, or Build 4 live queue files.
- Do not edit runtime code unless the active task explicitly allows it.
- Do not edit files owned by another active build task.
- Keep scope tight.
- Run requested tests if the task calls for tests.
- Commit only your slice.
- Push to `origin/main`.
- Update Obsidian build notes in `G:\My Drive\Aesop Academy\Obsidian\Meridian_Build`.
- Mark completed slices `Ready for Codex Review` in this file. Include commit hash, files changed, and tests run so `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` can clear or route repairs.

## Active Task

Current Active Task (supersedes any stale text below):

Goal: design the Harness dashboard surface for Bifrost V0.

Allowed files only:

- `docs/bifrost-harness-dashboard-brief.md`

Task:

- Write a concise product/architecture brief for the Harness button/dashboard Scott requested.
- Cover:
  - where the Harness button belongs in the cockpit/nav
  - what the dashboard shows for each harness: Relay, Bifrost, Beacon, Aegis, Compass, FileMap/Echo, queue/review harness
  - what is view-only in V0 versus editable later
  - how to show harness maturity/build numbers
  - how to show health and liveness without turning into a worker-card wall
  - how Prime uses the dashboard versus how Scott uses it
  - how this dashboard relates to the Review Console and Orchestrator Queue
  - what V0 should intentionally leave out
- Keep it design-only.
- Do not edit runtime code.
- Do not edit FileMap; Build 3 owns FileMap.
- Do not edit package exports; Build 2 owns package API.
- Do not edit other live queues.

Tests:

- No tests required. This is docs-only.

Completion:

- Commit only this docs slice.
- Push to `origin/main`.
- Update Obsidian.
- Mark this slice `Ready for Codex Review` with commit hash, files changed, and tests run.

Stale prior text:

Goal: design the V0 cockpit layout around Prime and the Review Console.

Allowed files only:

- `docs/bifrost-v0-cockpit-layout-brief.md`

Task:

- Write a concise product/architecture brief for the V0 cockpit layout.
- Cover:
  - Prime as the dominant top/center relationship surface
  - Orchestrator Queue and Review Console as tabbed prompt surfaces
  - bottom or side instrumentation for Beacon, Relay, Aegis, Compass, Bifrost, queue state
  - where the Harness button belongs and what it opens
  - how much worker/session detail is visible by default
  - how Mission Objectives can be called up on demand
  - how the NASA-style Go sequence should appear visually without becoming noise
  - how the layout scales from 3 lanes to 25 lanes
  - what V0 should intentionally leave out
- Keep it design-only.
- Do not edit runtime code.
- Do not edit FileMap; Build 3 owns FileMap.
- Do not edit package exports; Build 2 owns package API.
- Do not edit other live queues.

Tests:

- No tests required. This is docs-only.

Completion:

- Commit only this docs slice.
- Push to `origin/main`.
- Update Obsidian.
