# Live Build 5 Queue

This file is the standing assignment queue for Build 5.

Build 5 is the Bifrost / session-harness product lane. It should work on UI behavior briefs, session queue activation, cockpit interaction contracts, and user-facing workflow design. It should not implement runtime code unless Codex explicitly assigns a code slice later.

When idle, check this file every 30 seconds. If there is an active task below, execute it. If the task is complete, commit and push your slice, update Obsidian, then report completion in your session and return to polling this file.

Rules:

- This session must behave as a live worker, not a one-shot handoff. After completing a task, return to this file and keep polling every 30 seconds.
- If there is no Active Task, do not stop. Append a Read Checks entry, wait 30 seconds, pull latest, and check again.
- Always pull latest `origin/main` before editing.
- Every time you check/read this file, add a timestamped entry to the Read Checks section.
- Every time you modify this file or complete a task from it, add a timestamped entry to the Write/Completion Log section.
- Every minute while idle, check for cross-check activity relevant to your slice: review notes, Codex findings, Aegis findings, failing tests, or Obsidian build log updates.
- If cross-check activity affects your task, record it in this file's Cross-Check Activity section and address it before starting unrelated work.
- After completing a task, mark the slice `Ready for Codex Review` with commit hash, files changed, and tests run.
- Do not perform your own Codex review. A separate Codex Reviews lane owns independent review, findings, and repair routing.
- If the Codex Reviews lane writes a repair task into this file, complete that repair before taking unrelated work.
- After every three completed task-changing commits, pause normal build work until the Codex Reviews lane records a cadence review result.
- Use local time with timezone when possible.
- Own only the files listed in the active task.
- Do not edit Build 1, Build 2, Build 3, or Build 4 live queue files.
- Do not edit runtime code unless the active task explicitly allows it.
- Do not edit files owned by another active build task.
- Keep scope tight.
- Run requested tests if the task calls for tests.
- Commit only your slice.
- Push to `origin/main`.
- Update Obsidian build notes in `G:\My Drive\Aesop Academy\Obsidian\Meridian_Build`.
- Mark completed slices `Ready for Codex Review` in this file. Include commit hash, files changed, and tests run so `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` can clear or route repairs.

## Cross-Check Activity

Append entries here when you check or act on cross-check activity.

```text
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 5 cross-check: none/finding/fix; details: <short note>
2026-05-30 12:28 -06:00 - Build 5 cross-check: self-reported boundary cross; details: heartbeat commit 5d60bb6 accidentally captured a Build 4 lane heartbeat entry in docs/live-build-4.md (1-line addition Build 4 had unstaged in the worktree). The added content is legitimate Build 4 work, not edits I authored; the boundary cross is that I committed a file outside my Allowed set (rule 24). Root cause: `git add docs/live-build-5.md` was preceded by stash/pop sequences that left other lanes' files in a partially-tracked state. Going forward, using `git commit -- docs/live-build-5.md` (explicit pathspec) on top of explicit add to lock the commit scope. No revert performed — the line is correct Build 4 content and rewriting history would affect other lanes.
2026-05-30 13:28 -06:00 - Build 5 cross-check: second self-reported boundary cross; details: heartbeat commit c3ee045 again captured a single legitimate Build 4 line in docs/live-build-4.md. Root cause: my prior `git commit -- docs/live-build-5.md` returned "nothing to commit" (worktree momentarily clean from a background git op), so I retried with `git add docs/live-build-5.md && git commit -m "..."` (no pathspec). docs/live-build-4.md had been silently left in the index by an earlier stash/pop sequence; the commit picked it up. Going forward, ALWAYS `git reset HEAD` before `git add` to clear the index, AND keep the explicit pathspec on `git commit -m "..." -- docs/live-build-5.md`. No revert — the captured Build 4 line is legitimate Build 4 content.
2026-05-30 14:00 -06:00 - Build 5 cross-check: observed inbound boundary cross from Build 3; details: Build 3 commit 902cb4c (titled "Build 3 read check — idle (01:05 Jun 1); 330f200 complete, cadence 2/3") accidentally included a Build 5 Read Checks line (my 13:59 heartbeat) in docs/live-build-5.md. The added content is correct Build 5 work that I authored locally but had not yet committed; Build 3's worktree had it silently staged via a prior stash/pop. Effect: my own 13:59 line is now on origin via Build 3's commit, and `git commit` reports "nothing to commit" because the local edit matches HEAD. No revert — the line is correct. Same root cause as my 12:28 and 13:28 boundary crosses, just inbound this time. Reinforces that the silently-staged cross-lane file pattern is a general worktree-coordination problem, not Build 5-specific.
```

## Codex Review Cadence

After every three completed changes/commits by Build 5, request a Codex review check before starting another task. The review check should automatically repair actionable findings in Build 5-owned files, rerun relevant tests if any, commit/push fixes, and report the result here.

```text
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 5 Codex review requested after commits <hash1>, <hash2>, <hash3>
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 5 Codex review finding: <severity>; details: <short note>
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 5 Codex review repair: commit <hash>; tests <result>; details: <short note>
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 5 Codex review result: pass/no actionable findings/fixed; details: <short note>
```

## Active Task

Current Active Task (supersedes any stale text below):

Goal: draft the V1 Bifrost cockpit implementation brief.

Context:

- V0 is CLI-first, but V1 should turn Prime into the cockpit-backed orchestrator experience.
- Build 5 owns Bifrost/product-surface thinking.
- Use existing Bifrost briefs as source material, but do not edit them in this slice.

Allowed files only:

- `docs/v1-bifrost-cockpit-implementation-brief.md`
- `docs/live-build-5.md`

Task:

- Write a concise implementation brief for the first real Bifrost cockpit.
- Cover:
  - page/screen layout
  - Prime main conversation surface
  - non-orchestrator/review/system prompt surface
  - progress/proof right-side surface
  - harness dashboard entry point
  - queue state and worker/session visibility
  - how Q polling becomes Prime-owned rather than human-owned
  - what should be configurable
  - what V1 should intentionally leave out
  - first five UI slices to build
- Keep it product/implementation-oriented.
- Do not edit runtime code.
- Do not edit FileMap.
- Do not edit package exports.
- Do not edit other live queues.

Tests:

- No tests required. This is docs-only.

Completion:

- Commit only this docs slice.
- Push to `origin/main`.
- Update Obsidian.
- Mark this slice `Ready for Codex Review` with commit hash, files changed, and tests run.

Stale prior text follows.

Goal: design the configurable Bifrost progress and proof surface.

Context:

- Scott wants 10-minute progress reports and proof/review updates to appear in a configurable right-side/progress window, not dumped into the main orchestrator conversation.
- The Codex review sessions also need to communicate proof status more clearly when they poll.

Allowed files only:

- `docs/bifrost-configurable-progress-surface-brief.md`
- `docs/live-build-5.md`

Task:

- Write a concise product/architecture brief for the configurable progress surface.
- Cover:
  - right-side progress surface behavior
  - Review Console tab/card routing
  - Orchestrator Queue routing
  - session-card diagnostic log routing
  - external notifications later
  - message categories: routine progress, blocker, review result, proof summary, repair routed, completion, human gate, system health
  - user controls: pin, mute, collapse, filter, redirect, clear, severity threshold
  - how Prime decides where a message goes
  - how Scott can override routing
  - how this relates to the non-orchestrator prompt window
  - what V0 should intentionally leave out
- Keep it design-only.
- Do not edit runtime code.
- Do not edit FileMap.
- Do not edit package exports.
- Do not edit other live queues.

Tests:

- No tests required. This is docs-only.

Completion:

- Commit only this docs slice.
- Push to `origin/main`.
- Update Obsidian.
- Mark this slice `Ready for Codex Review` with commit hash, files changed, and tests run.

Stale prior text follows.

Goal: design the Harness dashboard surface for Bifrost V0.

Allowed files only:

- `docs/bifrost-harness-dashboard-brief.md`

Task:

- Write a concise product/architecture brief for the Harness button/dashboard Scott requested.
- Cover:
  - where the Harness button belongs in the cockpit/nav
  - what the dashboard shows for each harness: Relay, Bifrost, Beacon, Aegis, Compass, FileMap/Echo, queue/review harness
  - what is view-only in V0 versus editable later
  - how to show harness maturity/build numbers
  - how to show health and liveness without turning into a worker-card wall
  - how Prime uses the dashboard versus how Scott uses it
  - how this dashboard relates to the Review Console and Orchestrator Queue
  - what V0 should intentionally leave out
- Keep it design-only.
- Do not edit runtime code.
- Do not edit FileMap; Build 3 owns FileMap.
- Do not edit package exports; Build 2 owns package API.
- Do not edit other live queues.

Tests:

- No tests required. This is docs-only.

Completion:

- Commit only this docs slice.
- Push to `origin/main`.
- Update Obsidian.
- Mark this slice `Ready for Codex Review` with commit hash, files changed, and tests run.

Stale prior text:

Goal: design the V0 cockpit layout around Prime and the Review Console.

Allowed files only:

- `docs/bifrost-v0-cockpit-layout-brief.md`

Task:

- Write a concise product/architecture brief for the V0 cockpit layout.
- Cover:
  - Prime as the dominant top/center relationship surface
  - Orchestrator Queue and Review Console as tabbed prompt surfaces
  - bottom or side instrumentation for Beacon, Relay, Aegis, Compass, Bifrost, queue state
  - where the Harness button belongs and what it opens
  - how much worker/session detail is visible by default
  - how Mission Objectives can be called up on demand
  - how the NASA-style Go sequence should appear visually without becoming noise
  - how the layout scales from 3 lanes to 25 lanes
  - what V0 should intentionally leave out
- Keep it design-only.
- Do not edit runtime code.
- Do not edit FileMap; Build 3 owns FileMap.
- Do not edit package exports; Build 2 owns package API.
- Do not edit other live queues.

Tests:

- No tests required. This is docs-only.

Completion:

- Commit only this docs slice.
- Push to `origin/main`.
- Update Obsidian.
- Mark this slice `Ready for Codex Review` with commit hash, files changed, and tests run.
