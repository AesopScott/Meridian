# Live Build 5 Queue

This file is the standing assignment queue for Build 5.

Build 5 is the Bifrost / session-harness product lane. It should work on UI behavior briefs, session queue activation, cockpit interaction contracts, and user-facing workflow design. It should not implement runtime code unless Codex explicitly assigns a code slice later.

When idle, check this file every 30 seconds. If there is an active task below, execute it. If the task is complete, commit and push your slice, update Obsidian, then report completion in your session and return to polling this file.

Rules:

- This session must behave as a live worker, not a one-shot handoff. After completing a task, return to this file and keep polling every 30 seconds.
- If there is no Active Task, do not stop. Append a Read Checks entry, wait 30 seconds, pull latest, and check again.
- Always pull latest `origin/main` before editing.
- Every time you check/read this file, add a timestamped entry to the Read Checks section.
- Every time you modify this file or complete a task from it, add a timestamped entry to the Write/Completion Log section.
- Every minute while idle, check for cross-check activity relevant to your slice: review notes, Codex findings, Aegis findings, failing tests, or Obsidian build log updates.
- If cross-check activity affects your task, record it in this file's Cross-Check Activity section and address it before starting unrelated work.
- After every three completed changes/commits from this build session, stop normal build work and request a Codex review check before taking another task.
- The Codex review check must automatically repair actionable findings in your owned files, rerun relevant tests if any, commit/push fixes, and report findings/fixes back in this file's heartbeat sections.
- Record Codex review requests, findings, repairs, and outcomes in the Codex Review Cadence section.
- Use local time with timezone when possible.
- Own only the files listed in the active task.
- Do not edit Build 1, Build 2, Build 3, or Build 4 live queue files.
- Do not edit runtime code unless the active task explicitly allows it.
- Do not edit files owned by another active build task.
- Keep scope tight.
- Run requested tests if the task calls for tests.
- Commit only your slice.
- Push to `origin/main`.
- Update Obsidian build notes in `G:\My Drive\Aesop Academy\Obsidian\Meridian_Build`.

## Read Checks

Append entries here when this file is checked while idle.

```text
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 5 checked queue; status: idle/running/blocked
```

## Write/Completion Log

Append entries here when this file is modified or an active task is completed.

```text
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 5 completed <task>; commit <hash>; tests <result>
2026-05-30 11:30 -06:00 - Codex created Build 5 Bifrost/session-harness queue and assigned queue activation brief; commit pending; tests not required
```

## Cross-Check Activity

Append entries here when you check or act on cross-check activity.

```text
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 5 cross-check: none/finding/fix; details: <short note>
```

## Codex Review Cadence

After every three completed changes/commits by Build 5, request a Codex review check before starting another task. The review check should automatically repair actionable findings in Build 5-owned files, rerun relevant tests if any, commit/push fixes, and report the result here.

```text
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 5 Codex review requested after commits <hash1>, <hash2>, <hash3>
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 5 Codex review finding: <severity>; details: <short note>
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 5 Codex review repair: commit <hash>; tests <result>; details: <short note>
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 5 Codex review result: pass/no actionable findings/fixed; details: <short note>
```

## Active Task

Goal: create the Meridian session queue activation brief.

Allowed files only:

- `docs/bifrost-session-queue-activation-brief.md`

Task:

- Write a concise architecture/product brief for how Meridian should eventually turn queue polling on from the UI/session harness.
- Treat the Polaris Q button as a prototype, not the final architecture.
- Cover:
  - what a global queue activation control should do
  - what per-session Q state should do
  - how active sessions are discovered
  - how the UI should show polling enabled/disabled/running/blocked
  - how queue file assignment should work without guessing from card names
  - how Prime should control this in Meridian instead of Scott manually clicking every worker card
  - how Beacon should report liveness/stale polling
  - how Bifrost should surface human-readable status without becoming the worker wall again
  - how this differs from the current Polaris implementation
- Include a small "do not build yet" section naming what should remain design-only until Meridian has a real session harness.
- Keep this docs-only and strategic.
- Do not edit runtime code.
- Do not edit FileMap; Build 3 owns FileMap.
- Do not edit package exports; Build 2 owns package API.
- Do not edit other live queues.

Tests:

- No tests required. This is docs-only.

Completion:

- Commit only this docs slice.
- Push to `origin/main`.
- Update Obsidian.
- Report commit hash in your session.
