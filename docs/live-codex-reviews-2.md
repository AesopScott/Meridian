# Live Codex Reviews B Queue

This file is the standing queue for a second specialized Codex Reviews session.

Review A and Review B are a scaling prototype for Prime. When review pressure backs up, Prime should be able to spawn additional review capacity, assign bounded scope, and merge the results back into the shared checkpoint ledger.

## Q Polling Source of Truth

When the Polaris `Q` button is enabled for **Codex Reviews B**, the session must read this file first and treat this file as its executable queue. Build queue files are review inputs only: inspect them for `Ready for Codex Review` markers, cadence triggers, commit hashes, and repair status, but do not execute build-lane Active Tasks from a review session.

## Role

Codex Reviews B owns docs, architecture, FileMap, Bifrost, and strategic consistency reviews unless Prime assigns a different scope.

Codex Reviews A (`docs/live-codex-reviews.md`) owns runtime, package API, tests, behavior, and code-level regression reviews unless Prime assigns a different scope.

Both review lanes must declare scope before reviewing, and neither lane may silently broaden scope into the other's territory.

## Rules

- Always pull latest `origin/main` before reviewing.
- Do not implement product code.
- Do not edit runtime files, package exports, or tests.
- Own review coordination files, docs/architecture review records, and repair routing only.
- Review completed build slices by commit hash.
- Inspect the target diff and directly necessary supporting docs only.
- Record proofs for every review pass. A pass without proof is not a clearance; it is only an opinion.
- For docs-only slices, check for stale claims, contradictions, missing references, FileMap gaps, and scope drift.
- Record review results in this file.
- If a docs/architecture finding requires repair, write the repair Active Task back into the original build lane queue.
- CRITICAL and HIGH findings block the lane until repaired.
- MEDIUM findings should usually be repaired before more work unless intentionally deferred.
- LOW findings may be deferred, but must be recorded.
- Update Obsidian build notes in `G:\My Drive\Aesop Academy\Obsidian\Meridian_Build` when a review finds or clears important architecture issues.

## Review Inputs

Poll these files:

- `docs/live-build-3.md`
- `docs/live-build-4.md`
- `docs/live-build-5.md`
- `docs/live-codex-reviews.md`

Look for:

- `Ready for Codex Review`
- completed docs/architecture commits without a review result
- FileMap changes that need consistency checks
- Bifrost/cockpit/interface briefs that need architecture alignment
- repair tasks waiting for verification

## Checkpoint Ledger

| Build lane | Last reviewed commit | Last reviewed task | Review status | Pending finding / repair | Next action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Build 3 | 1378bda | FileMap repair — register 4 uncatalogued docs (Round B2) | passed | Round B1 MEDIUM repair verified closed; 1 new MEDIUM finding (live-codex-reviews-2.md still uncatalogued); 2 LOW prose-divergence carryovers from Round B1 still deferred | route 1-row FileMap follow-up to Build 3 for `docs/live-codex-reviews-2.md`; verify in Round B3 |
| Build 4 | 1d17fa1 | Prime orchestration state model (Round B1) | passed | LOW severity-ladder design question recorded | clarify FindingSeverity↔EvidenceSeverity mapping when Build 4 next picks up state-model implementation slice |
| Build 5 | 9328272 | V1 Harness Dashboard implementation | passed Round B8 | no findings; final V1 cockpit item cleared | V1 cockpit build is review-cleared |

## Review Round Scope

Before starting each review round, write the scope here.

```text
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Round B<n> scope
Build lanes: <Build 3, Build 4, Build 5>
Commit range(s): <Build 3 abc; Build 4 def; Build 5 ghi>
Allowed review files: <diff files only or named supporting files>
Tests to run: <targeted tests or docs-only>
Out of scope: <runtime/API/test areas owned by Review A>
Reason: <ready marker, cadence review, repair verification, user request>
```

2026-05-30 23:30 -06:00 - Round B1 scope
Build lanes: Build 3, Build 4, Build 5
Commit range(s): Build 3 4075ef4 (queue marker 6879bd9); Build 4 1d17fa1 (queue marker 14ae1e9); Build 5 7c34566 (queue marker 3026216)
Allowed review files: diff files only — docs/FileMap.md, meridian_core/filemap.py, tests/test_filemap.py (Build 3); docs/prime-orchestration-state-model.md, docs/live-build-4.md (Build 4); docs/bifrost-harness-dashboard-brief.md, docs/live-build-5.md (Build 5). Queue marker diffs to docs/live-build-3.md, docs/live-build-4.md, docs/live-build-5.md.
Tests to run: `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py -q` (Build 3); Build 4 and Build 5 are docs-only.
Out of scope: runtime/package-API/behavior reviews of relay_dispatch.py, prompt_packet, review_console, council, beacon, registry; product test suites (owned by Review A).
Reason: Coordinator-queued Round B1 to clear docs/architecture slices Ready for Codex Review across all three build lanes.

2026-05-31 10:20 -06:00 - Round B2 scope
Build lanes: Build 3 (repair verification only)
Commit range(s): Build 3 1378bda (FileMap repair for 4 uncatalogued docs — verifies the consolidated repair routed in Round B1)
Allowed review files: diff files only — docs/FileMap.md, meridian_core/filemap.py, tests/test_filemap.py. Cross-reference: this very queue file's Repair Routing Log entry from 2026-05-30 23:30 (the routed repair being verified).
Tests to run: `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py -q`.
Out of scope: Build 4 and Build 5 (no new Ready for Codex Review markers since Round B1; their lanes are awaiting reassignment, not new review). Runtime/package-API/behavior reviews (owned by Review A). Build 1's `lane_state` slice marked Ready for Codex Review (`13b4b48`) is runtime/API scope, owned by Review A.
Reason: Build 3 marked commit 1378bda Ready for Codex Review — Reviews B Round B2 in the Build 3 queue; this round verifies the Round B1-routed MEDIUM FileMap-gap repair is closed.

2026-05-31 02:58 -06:00 - Round B7 scope
Build lanes: Build 5
Commit range(s): Build 5 e1bf9db (V1 configurable progress/proof surface implementation)
Allowed review files: diff files only - bifrost/cockpit.py, bifrost/static/cockpit.css, tests/test_bifrost_cockpit.py, docs/live-build-5.md for provenance.
Tests to run: `python -m pytest tests/test_bifrost_cockpit.py tests/test_cockpit_state.py -q`.
Out of scope: unrelated runtime/API changes, FileMap changes, and additional Bifrost feature implementation.
Reason: Build 5 marked e1bf9db Ready for Codex Review; this is the third task-changing commit in the current Build 5 cadence window and must clear before more Build 5 implementation work.

2026-05-31 03:31 -06:00 - Round B8 scope
Build lanes: Build 5
Commit range(s): Build 5 9328272 (V1 Harness Dashboard implementation)
Allowed review files: diff files only - bifrost/__init__.py, bifrost/cockpit.py, bifrost/static/cockpit.css, tests/test_bifrost_cockpit.py, docs/live-build-5.md for provenance.
Tests to run: `python -m pytest tests/test_bifrost_cockpit.py tests/test_cockpit_state.py -q`.
Out of scope: runtime/live state harvesting, persistence, JavaScript, mutation controls, FileMap changes, and non-Bifrost package APIs.
Reason: Build 5 marked 9328272 Ready for Codex Review; this is the final V1 cockpit item and should be reviewed before declaring V1 complete.

## Review Log

Append one entry per reviewed slice.

```text
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Reviewed Build <n> commit <hash>; result: pass/finding/blocked; tests: <summary>; notes: <short note>
```

2026-05-30 23:30 -06:00 - Reviewed Build 3 commit 4075ef4 (+ queue marker 6879bd9); result: pass; tests: `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py -q` → 46/46 passed in 0.09s; notes: FileMap.md ↔ filemap.py ↔ tests internally consistent; new `RELAY_DISPATCH` area placed sensibly; both new doc rows match registered FileMapEntries by path; referenced files (`meridian_core/relay_dispatch.py`, `tests/test_relay_dispatch.py`, `docs/live-codex-reviews.md`, `docs/prime-orchestration-harness-prototype.md`) exist. Two LOW prose-divergence findings recorded.
2026-05-30 23:30 -06:00 - Reviewed Build 4 commit 1d17fa1 (+ queue marker 14ae1e9); result: pass-with-findings; tests: docs-only; notes: state model is internally consistent, cross-references to `meridian_core/aegis.py` (EvidenceSeverity, AegisEvidence), `meridian_core/models.py` (TaskStatus), `meridian_core/builds.py`, `docs/meridian-pillars.md`, `docs/review-console-surface-contract.md`, `docs/bifrost-cockpit-queue-status-brief.md`, `docs/prime-orchestration-harness-prototype.md`, `docs/v0-build-readiness-map.md` all verified present. Doc explicitly defers FileMap edits to Build 3 — gap routed accordingly. Severity-ladder reuse/alias question recorded as LOW.
2026-05-30 23:30 -06:00 - Reviewed Build 5 commit 7c34566 (+ queue marker 3026216); result: pass-with-findings; tests: docs-only; notes: Bifrost Harness dashboard brief is internally consistent and aligns with companion briefs (session-queue activation, cockpit queue status, V0 cockpit layout). §5 reference to bifrost-v0-cockpit-layout-brief.md §5 verified. Cross-references to `docs/cockpit-ui-architecture.md`, `docs/prime-wake-sequence-build-brief.md`, `docs/meridian-capabilities-architecture-map.md` all exist on disk. Brief explicitly disclaims FileMap edits — gap routed to Build 3.
2026-05-31 10:20 -06:00 - Reviewed Build 3 commit 1378bda (Round B2 repair verification); result: pass-with-findings; tests: `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py -q` → 46/46 passed in 0.12s; notes: all 4 routed docs (`docs/v0-build-readiness-map.md`, `docs/prime-orchestration-state-model.md`, `docs/bifrost-v0-cockpit-layout-brief.md`, `docs/bifrost-harness-dashboard-brief.md`) registered in both docs/FileMap.md and meridian_core/filemap.py with matching purpose/notes prose (no new divergence introduced); FileArea taxonomy correct (ARCHITECTURE for state model + V0 readiness map; BIFROST for both Bifrost briefs); all 4 paths added to `_REQUIRED_PATHS`. Round B1 MEDIUM repair closed. NEW MEDIUM finding: `docs/live-codex-reviews-2.md` was created since 4075ef4 (commit `3de9c74`) and remains uncatalogued; Build 3 did not note it in cross-check despite the Active Task's instruction to flag any other new docs there. Round B1 LOW prose-divergence findings on the existing `live-codex-reviews.md` and `prime-orchestration-harness-prototype.md` entries remain deferred (Build 3 did not opportunistically fold them in; permitted by task scope).

2026-05-31 03:11 -06:00 - Reviewed Build 5 commit e1bf9db (Round B7 cadence review); result: pass; tests: `python -m pytest tests/test_bifrost_cockpit.py tests/test_cockpit_state.py -q` -> 97/97 passed in 0.13s; notes: progress events remain render-only and deterministic, no queue/log/env/prompt reads, no JavaScript, no persistence; category/severity/source/timestamp/summary/drilldown are escaped; severity counts and CSS hooks are stable; snapshot mapping preserves typed category/severity.
2026-05-31 03:41 -06:00 - Reviewed Build 5 commit 9328272 (Round B8 final V1 cockpit review); result: pass; tests: `python -m pytest tests/test_bifrost_cockpit.py tests/test_cockpit_state.py -q` -> 104/104 passed in 0.13s; notes: Harness Dashboard is static, view-only, grouped, and escaped; no queue/log/env/prompt reads, no JavaScript, no persistence, and no mutation controls; existing Bifrost files are already registered so no FileMap repair is required.

## Proof Log

Append proof entries here before marking a slice passed.

Proof is the evidence behind the review result. It should be short, specific, and reproducible enough that Prime can later turn it into Aegis evidence or Review Console proof cards.

```text
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Proof for Build <n> commit <hash>; proof type: diff/test/reference/manual; evidence: <short reproducible evidence>; result: pass/fail/deferred
```

2026-05-30 23:30 -06:00 - Proof for Build 3 commit 4075ef4; proof type: test/reference; evidence: `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py -q` passed 46/46 and referenced files (`meridian_core/relay_dispatch.py`, `tests/test_relay_dispatch.py`, `docs/live-codex-reviews.md`, `docs/prime-orchestration-harness-prototype.md`) exist; result: pass.
2026-05-30 23:30 -06:00 - Proof for Build 4 commit 1d17fa1; proof type: reference/manual; evidence: referenced architecture/domain files exist; doc explicitly defers FileMap edits to Build 3; severity-ladder concern recorded as LOW; result: pass-with-findings.
2026-05-30 23:30 -06:00 - Proof for Build 5 commit 7c34566; proof type: reference/manual; evidence: companion Bifrost briefs and referenced architecture docs exist; FileMap gap routed to Build 3; result: pass-with-findings.
2026-05-31 10:20 -06:00 - Proof for Build 3 commit 1378bda (Round B2 repair verification); proof type: test/diff/reference; evidence: `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py -q` → 46/46 passed in 0.12s; `git show 1378bda -- docs/FileMap.md meridian_core/filemap.py tests/test_filemap.py` confirms 4 matching pairs of FileMap.md rows + filemap.py FileMapEntry plus 4 additions to `_REQUIRED_PATHS`; `git log --diff-filter=A --name-only 4075ef4..HEAD -- 'docs/*.md'` shows three docs added post-baseline of which only `docs/live-codex-reviews-2.md` remains uncatalogued; result: pass for the original Round B1 repair scope, with one new MEDIUM finding to be re-verified in Round B3.

Minimum proof expectations:

- FileMap slices: `tests/test_filemap.py` plus path/reference verification.
- Docs/architecture slices: referenced-file existence checks plus contradiction/scope inspection.
- UI/product briefs: companion-doc reference checks plus V0/V1 scope consistency.
- Repair verification: original finding, repair commit, and test/reference evidence that the finding is closed.

2026-05-31 03:11 -06:00 - Proof for Build 5 commit e1bf9db; proof type: test/diff/manual; evidence: `git show --stat --oneline e1bf9db -- bifrost/cockpit.py bifrost/static/cockpit.css tests/test_bifrost_cockpit.py docs/live-build-5.md` shows the bounded Build 5 progress-surface slice; `python -m pytest tests/test_bifrost_cockpit.py tests/test_cockpit_state.py -q` -> 97/97 passed; manual inspection confirms no live reads, no JavaScript, escaped metadata, stable severity count hooks, and typed snapshot category/severity mapping; result: pass.
2026-05-31 03:41 -06:00 - Proof for Build 5 commit 9328272; proof type: test/diff/manual; evidence: `git show --stat --oneline 9328272 -- bifrost/__init__.py bifrost/cockpit.py bifrost/static/cockpit.css tests/test_bifrost_cockpit.py docs/live-build-5.md` shows a bounded Bifrost Harness Dashboard slice; `python -m pytest tests/test_bifrost_cockpit.py tests/test_cockpit_state.py -q` -> 104/104 passed; manual inspection confirms view-only grouped cards, capability chips, planned placeholders, attention/status hooks, escaped harness text, and no new file paths requiring FileMap registration; result: pass.

## Findings

Append findings here before routing repairs.

```text
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build <n> commit <hash>; severity: CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW; file: <path>; finding: <short note>; action: clear/defer/repair-task-written
```

2026-05-30 23:30 -06:00 - Build 3 commit 4075ef4; severity: LOW; file: docs/FileMap.md vs meridian_core/filemap.py (entry for `docs/live-codex-reviews.md`); finding: prose divergence — FileMap.md says "repair routing back to build lanes" while filemap.py says just "repair routing". Semantically equivalent but a strict consistency check flags the difference; action: defer (LOW per rules; folded into the consolidated FileMap repair task as opportunistic cleanup).
2026-05-30 23:30 -06:00 - Build 3 commit 4075ef4; severity: LOW; file: docs/FileMap.md vs meridian_core/filemap.py (entry for `docs/prime-orchestration-harness-prototype.md`); finding: FileMap.md row lists "slice assignment, lane routing, allowed-file ownership, completion signals, and review coordination" while filemap.py entry omits "allowed-file ownership". Same prose-divergence pattern as the live-codex-reviews entry; action: defer (LOW; folded into the consolidated FileMap repair task as opportunistic cleanup).
2026-05-30 23:30 -06:00 - Build 4 commit 1d17fa1; severity: MEDIUM; file: docs/FileMap.md and meridian_core/filemap.py (missing entries); finding: `docs/prime-orchestration-state-model.md` (created in this slice) and `docs/v0-build-readiness-map.md` (created earlier in Build 4 commit `3cbf336`) are both uncatalogued. Build 4 explicitly defers FileMap edits to Build 3 in the state-model doc itself, so this is a Build 3 follow-up; action: repair-task-written (bundled with the Build 5 missing entries into a single Build 3 Active Task).
2026-05-30 23:30 -06:00 - Build 4 commit 1d17fa1; severity: LOW; file: docs/prime-orchestration-state-model.md line 195; finding: state model proposes `FindingSeverity → EvidenceSeverity (reuse or alias)` but the ladders differ — review prototype uses CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW (also the convention used in this very queue), while `meridian_core/aegis.py` EvidenceSeverity uses INFO/WARNING/ERROR/CRITICAL. A direct alias cannot preserve LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH granularity. Doc acknowledges the open decision; action: defer (LOW; expect the next Build 4 implementation slice to surface this as a typed-enum decision before any Python is written).
2026-05-30 23:30 -06:00 - Build 5 commit 7c34566; severity: MEDIUM; file: docs/FileMap.md and meridian_core/filemap.py (missing entries); finding: `docs/bifrost-harness-dashboard-brief.md` (created in this slice) and `docs/bifrost-v0-cockpit-layout-brief.md` (created earlier in Build 5 commit `d1d32af`) are both uncatalogued. Brief explicitly disclaims FileMap edits in §15 (docs-only, strategic, "does not authorize runtime code, FileMap edits, or package-API changes"), so this is a Build 3 follow-up; action: repair-task-written (bundled with the Build 4 missing entries into a single Build 3 Active Task).
2026-05-31 10:20 -06:00 - Build 3 commit 1378bda; severity: MEDIUM; file: docs/FileMap.md and meridian_core/filemap.py (missing entry); finding: `docs/live-codex-reviews-2.md` was created in commit `3de9c74` (post-baseline 4075ef4) and is still absent from both FileMap.md and filemap.py. Parallel to the already-cataloged `docs/live-codex-reviews.md`. Build 3's 1378bda Active Task explicitly asked "note them in the cross-check section, do not silently bundle" for other new docs, but Build 3 did neither (no cross-check entry, no inclusion); action: repair-task-written (small follow-up Active Task into docs/live-build-3.md — one FileMap.md row, one FileMapEntry, one `_REQUIRED_PATHS` line).
2026-05-31 10:20 -06:00 - Build 3 commit 1378bda; severity: LOW (carryover); file: docs/FileMap.md vs meridian_core/filemap.py (entries for `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` and `docs/prime-orchestration-harness-prototype.md`); finding: the 2 LOW prose-divergence findings recorded in Round B1 remain present; Build 3 1378bda did not opportunistically reconcile them (permitted by its Active Task's "out of scope" allowance); action: defer (re-recorded as carryover so the follow-up Build 3 task can fold them in opportunistically).

2026-05-30 23:30 -06:00 - Routed repair to Build 3; queue: docs/live-build-3.md; finding: register four uncatalogued docs in FileMap.md and filemap.py — `docs/v0-build-readiness-map.md`, `docs/prime-orchestration-state-model.md`, `docs/bifrost-v0-cockpit-layout-brief.md`, `docs/bifrost-harness-dashboard-brief.md`. Opportunistically reconcile LOW prose-divergence findings on the Build 3 4075ef4 entries; status: closed in Round B2 (Build 3 commit 1378bda — 4 docs registered, tests 46/46; LOW reconciliation deferred).
2026-05-31 10:20 -06:00 - Routed repair to Build 3; queue: docs/live-build-3.md; finding: register `docs/live-codex-reviews-2.md` in FileMap.md and meridian_core/filemap.py (one row + one FileMapEntry under FileArea.BUILD_PROCESS, parallel to the existing `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` entry) and add the path to `_REQUIRED_PATHS` in tests/test_filemap.py. Opportunistically (still permitted, not required) reconcile the two LOW prose-divergence carryovers on the existing `live-codex-reviews.md` and `prime-orchestration-harness-prototype.md` entries; status: pending.

## Active Task

Current Active Task (supersedes stale Round B4 text below):

Goal: perform Codex Reviews B Round B5 for the current V1 Bifrost startup wave.

Scope trigger:

- Build 5 completed the static Bifrost cockpit scaffold and marked commit `d13f1d1` Ready for Codex Review.
- Build 4 completed the V1 Bifrost cockpit integration sequence and marked commit `ed0fb75` Ready for Codex Review.
- Build 4's earlier live-data contract commit `56f626d` is still in this queue's active text and should be swept in the same docs/architecture round if not already cleared.

Immediate scope:

- Build 5 commit `d13f1d1` - first Bifrost cockpit scaffold.
- Build 4 commit `ed0fb75` - V1 Bifrost cockpit integration sequence.
- Build 4 commit `56f626d` - V1 Bifrost live-data integration contract, if no pass result is already recorded.

Files:

- `bifrost/__init__.py`
- `bifrost/cockpit.py`
- `bifrost/static/cockpit.css`
- `tests/test_bifrost_cockpit.py`
- `docs/v1-bifrost-integration-sequence.md`
- `docs/v1-bifrost-live-data-contract.md`
- `docs/live-build-4.md` and `docs/live-build-5.md` for provenance only.

Required proof:

- Inspect the target commit diffs with `git show`.
- Run `python -m pytest tests/test_bifrost_cockpit.py -q`.
- Confirm the scaffold is cockpit-first, dependency-free, escapes dynamic text, contains the requested nav buttons plus Harness, and exposes Prime/Review Console/lane/progress/instrument surfaces.
- Confirm the integration sequence keeps V1 scoped to Bifrost cockpit UI plus wiring existing V0/domain capabilities, and leaves Echo, Atlas, federation, public/provider strategy, and write-back actions out of V1.
- Confirm both docs preserve typed summaries rather than raw queue files/full logs/prompt-drag context.
- Check whether the new Bifrost files/docs need FileMap registration. If yes, route/verify Build 3 FileMap work rather than editing FileMap here.
- Record any rendering or mojibake/encoding concerns as findings with severity.

Output:

- Declare Round B5 scope.
- Update Review Ledger, Review Log, Proof Log, Findings, and Repair Routing Log.
- If clean, mark the Build 5 scaffold and Build 4 integration docs passed and unblock their next V1 wiring assignments.
- If actionable findings exist, route repairs to Build 5 for cockpit code/CSS, Build 4 for docs/architecture, or Build 3 for FileMap.

## Coordinator Addendum - Model Adapter FileMap Clearance

2026-05-30 16:11 MDT - Reviewed Build 3 commit `be34fea` plus queue marker `93d92ee`.

Result: pass. No actionable findings. No repairs routed.

Proof:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py -q` -> 46/46 passed.
- `git show be34fea -- docs/FileMap.md meridian_core/filemap.py tests/test_filemap.py` confirms `meridian_core/model_adapter.py` is registered in the human FileMap, code FileMap, and `_REQUIRED_PATHS`.
- The FileMap entry uses `FileArea.MODEL_HARNESS` and related test `tests/test_model_adapter.py`.
- The slice changed FileMap metadata and the Build 3 queue only; no runtime behavior or package exports were changed.

Build 3 cadence window `774695f`, `330f200`, `be34fea` is clear for this FileMap slice.

Current Active Task:

Goal: perform Codex Reviews B Round B4 for the new V1 Bifrost live-data contract.

Scope trigger:

- Build 4 completed `docs/v1-bifrost-live-data-contract.md` and marked the slice Ready for Codex Review.

Immediate scope:

- Build 4 commit `56f626d` - V1 Bifrost live-data integration contract.
- Files:
  - `docs/v1-bifrost-live-data-contract.md`
  - `docs/live-build-4.md` for provenance only.

Required proof:

- Inspect `git show 56f626d -- docs/v1-bifrost-live-data-contract.md docs/live-build-4.md`.
- Confirm the contract keeps V1 scoped to Bifrost cockpit live-data wiring and does not pull Echo, Atlas, federation, or public/provider strategy into V1.
- Confirm it preserves the "typed objects and summaries, not raw queue files/full logs/prompt-drag context" rule.
- Confirm each cockpit surface names an owner, current source, V1 domain object expectation, cadence, stale/degraded behavior, and prompt-exclusion rule.
- Cross-check against `docs/v1-bifrost-cockpit-implementation-brief.md`, `docs/v1-capability-plan.md`, and `docs/v0-v1-progress-tracker.md` for contradictions.
- Check whether `docs/v1-bifrost-live-data-contract.md` needs FileMap registration. If yes, route a Build 3 FileMap task instead of editing FileMap here.
- Since this is docs-only, no pytest is required unless a FileMap repair is routed.

Output:

- Declare Round B4 scope.
- Update Review Ledger, Review Log, Proof Log, Findings, and Repair Routing Log.
- If clean, mark Build 4 commit `56f626d` passed and Build 4 unblocked.
- If actionable findings exist, route a repair task to Build 4.

Stale prior active task follows.

Goal: perform Codex Reviews B Round B3 when the next docs/architecture slice is ready.

Scope trigger:

- Build 3 completion of the `docs/live-codex-reviews-2.md` FileMap repair, or
- Build 4 commit `fd9224d` - Prime status console and Review Console CLI bridge, or
- Build 5 completion of `docs/bifrost-configurable-progress-surface-brief.md`.

Immediate scope available now:

- Build 3 commit `be34fea` - Model Harness adapter FileMap registration.
- Build 3 queue marker `93d92ee` - marks `be34fea` Ready for Codex Review.
- Build 4 commit `fd9224d`.
- Build 4 commits `7b43848` / `9a4e6a4` - V1 capability plan and cockpit-scope revision.
- Build 4 commit `18e2767` - V3 parking lot.
- Build 5 commit `a412e90` - Bifrost configurable progress and proof surface brief.
- Build 5 commit `0629e0c` - V1 Bifrost cockpit implementation brief.
- Build 3 commit `774695f` - FileMap hygiene for the V0/V1 progress tracker and V0 readiness wording.

Required proof for Build 4:

- Inspect `docs/prime-status-console-cli-brief.md`.
- Confirm the brief routes NASA/system/proof messages to the non-orchestrator/review surface and keeps Prime's conversational thread clean.
- Confirm the proposed commands do not contradict existing Review Console, Wake Brief, Progress Intention, Beacon, or Bifrost docs.
- Check whether the new doc needs FileMap registration. If yes, route the FileMap task to Build 3 instead of editing FileMap here.
- Since this is docs-only, tests are not required; proof must be file inspection plus cross-reference checks.
- Also inspect `docs/v1-capability-plan.md`.
- Confirm V1 is scoped to Bifrost cockpit UI plus wiring existing V0/domain capabilities, and explicitly leaves Echo, Atlas, federation, and public/provider strategy out of V1.
- Also inspect `docs/v3-parking-lot.md`.
- Confirm V3 is clearly a parking lot, not active scope, and that all items are framed by Prime or harness ownership.
- Confirm the V3 doc does not pull product/ecosystem work into V0, V1, or V2.

Required proof for Build 5:

- Inspect `docs/bifrost-configurable-progress-surface-brief.md`.
- Confirm it supports configurable progress/proof routing without dumping routine system messages into Prime's main conversation.
- Confirm its message categories and user controls align with the Review Console, non-orchestrator prompt surface, and Bifrost cockpit direction.
- Check whether the new doc needs FileMap registration. If yes, route the FileMap task to Build 3 instead of editing FileMap here.
- Since this is docs-only, tests are not required; proof must be file inspection plus cross-reference checks.
- Also inspect `docs/v1-bifrost-cockpit-implementation-brief.md`.
- Confirm the first UI implementation slices are cockpit-first and do not accidentally pull V2 memory/federation/model-adapter work into V1.

Required proof for Build 3:

- Inspect commit `be34fea`.
- Run or verify `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py -q`.
- Confirm `meridian_core/model_adapter.py` is registered in `docs/FileMap.md`, `meridian_core/filemap.py`, and `_REQUIRED_PATHS`.
- Confirm related test coverage points to `tests/test_model_adapter.py`.
- Confirm no runtime or package export files were changed by the FileMap slice.
- Inspect commit `774695f`.
- Run or verify `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py -q`.
- Confirm `docs/v0-v1-progress-tracker.md` is registered and `_REQUIRED_PATHS` coverage is updated.
- Confirm V0 readiness wording now states the Relay executor skeleton exists while live vendor/model dispatch remains future work.

Output:

- Declare Round B3 scope.
- Update Review Ledger, Review Log, Proof Log, Findings, and Repair Routing Log.
- Route any actionable findings to the owning build lane.
- If clean, mark the reviewed slice passed and continue polling.

Stale prior status follows.

**Round B2 complete. Codex Reviews B is idle, awaiting Round B3.**

Round B2 result summary:

- Build 3 commit `1378bda` — PASS-WITH-FINDINGS. Tests: `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py -q` → 46/46 in 0.12s. The Round B1 MEDIUM FileMap-gap repair (4 docs) is verified closed: all 4 paths registered in both `docs/FileMap.md` and `meridian_core/filemap.py` with matching prose, correct FileArea taxonomy (ARCHITECTURE / BIFROST), and `_REQUIRED_PATHS` extended.
- New finding (MEDIUM): `docs/live-codex-reviews-2.md` was added in commit `3de9c74` (post-baseline `4075ef4`) and is still absent from FileMap. The Round B1 Active Task instructed Build 3 to note new uncatalogued docs in cross-check rather than bundle them; Build 3 did neither. One-row follow-up routed to Build 3.
- Carryovers (LOW × 2): the 2 prose-divergence findings on existing `live-codex-reviews.md` and `prime-orchestration-harness-prototype.md` entries remain deferred. Re-flagged as opportunistic for the new Build 3 repair.
- Repair routing: one small Build 3 follow-up Active Task written to `docs/live-build-3.md`. Build 4 and Build 5 untouched this round (no new Ready markers).
- Round B3 trigger: verify the new Build 3 follow-up when marked Ready for Codex Review; sweep any new Build 4 / Build 5 slices that arrive in the meantime.

Proof discipline (from Round B2 Active Task): commit hash + diff inspection + test command output + file-existence cross-check, all recorded above in Review Log / Proof Log / Findings / Repair Routing Log.

Polling cadence:

- When idle, append a Read Check entry every poll interval.
- When `Ready for Codex Review` markers appear in any of `docs/live-build-3.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`, `docs/live-build-5.md`, or when Review A flags a docs/architecture-shaped finding in `docs/live-codex-reviews.md`, declare a Round B<n+1> scope and begin.

Stale prior status follows.

**Round B1 complete. Codex Reviews B is idle, awaiting Round B2.**

Round B1 result summary:

- Build 3 commit `4075ef4` — PASS. Tests: `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py -q` → 46/46 in 0.09s. 2 LOW prose-divergence findings between `docs/FileMap.md` and `meridian_core/filemap.py` recorded; deferred and folded opportunistically into the Build 3 repair task.
- Build 4 commit `1d17fa1` — PASS. Tests: docs-only. 1 MEDIUM FileMap gap (state model + V0 readiness map) routed to Build 3. 1 LOW FindingSeverity↔EvidenceSeverity ladder-mismatch design question recorded against Build 4 for the next implementation slice.
- Build 5 commit `7c34566` — PASS. Tests: docs-only. 1 MEDIUM FileMap gap (Harness dashboard brief + V0 cockpit layout brief) bundled into the Build 3 repair task.
- Repair routing: one consolidated FileMap-gap task written to `docs/live-build-3.md`. Build 4 and Build 5 require no immediate action from their own lanes.
- Round B2 trigger: verify the Build 3 repair when Build 3 marks it Ready for Codex Review; also sweep any new slices that arrive from Build 4 or Build 5 in the meantime.

Polling cadence:

- When idle, append a Read Check entry every poll interval.
- When `Ready for Codex Review` markers appear in any of `docs/live-build-3.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`, `docs/live-build-5.md`, or when Review A flags a docs/architecture-shaped finding in `docs/live-codex-reviews.md`, declare a Round B<n+1> scope and begin.

## Coordinator Addendum - Round B5 V1 Cockpit Clearance

2026-05-31 01:13 MDT - Codex Reviews B Round B5 complete.

- Scope: Build 3 `ca6f55f` + `e89df81`; Build 4 `56f626d` + `ed0fb75`; Build 5 `d13f1d1`.
- Result: pass. No actionable findings. No repairs routed.
- Proof: `python -m pytest tests/test_bifrost_cockpit.py tests/test_filemap.py -q` -> 95/95 passed.
- Bifrost scaffold is dependency-free, escapes dynamic strings, and exposes the required nav buttons plus Prime, Review Console, lane strip, progress, and instrument surfaces.
- V1 Bifrost docs keep scope to cockpit UI plus live-data wiring from existing V0/domain capabilities.
- Echo, Atlas, federation, public/provider strategy, and cockpit write-back remain out of V1.
- FileMap now covers Bifrost scaffold files, cockpit-state domain/test files, and the V1 Bifrost contract/sequence docs.
- Build 3 cadence is cleared. Build 4 and Build 5 are unblocked for the next V1 cockpit wiring slices.

## Coordinator Addendum - Round B6 Review Scope Queued

2026-05-31 02:18 MDT - Round B6 scope queued by coordinator.

- Build 3: `c1ba27b` Prime cockpit provider FileMap registration.
- Build 4: `ec66081` V1 Bifrost cockpit runtime acceptance checklist.
- Build 5: `5c89e87` `PrimeCockpitSnapshot` to `CockpitViewModel` mapping.
- Build 2 context: `14315b3` package API export plus `f66bbde` cadence closure/format repair are runtime/API-shaped, so Reviews C may own detailed API review; Reviews B should note the V1 tracker impact only.
- Required proof for Build 3: `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py tests/test_cockpit_provider.py -q`; confirm `meridian_core/cockpit_provider.py` and `tests/test_cockpit_provider.py` are registered in `docs/FileMap.md`, `meridian_core/filemap.py`, and `_REQUIRED_PATHS`.
- Required proof for Build 4: inspect `docs/v1-bifrost-runtime-acceptance-checklist.md`; confirm it is V1-scoped, organized by Prime/harness ownership, includes proof expectations, and keeps Echo, Atlas, federation, public/account strategy, and vendor-specific model presets out of V1.
- Required proof for Build 5: `python -m pytest tests/test_bifrost_cockpit.py tests/test_cockpit_state.py -q`; confirm the adapter imports only stable cockpit-state types and maps project, bearing, review count, lanes, progress events, queue state, risk tier, and health indicators without reading files/logs/queues.
- If clean, mark both passed and keep Build 3/4 unblocked.
- Initial proof found a MEDIUM FileMap miss: `tests/test_cockpit_provider.py` was in `_REQUIRED_PATHS` and docs/FileMap.md but absent from `make_default_map()`. Coordinator repaired the missing `FileMapEntry`; rerun required proof before closing Round B6.
- Repair proof: `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py tests/test_cockpit_provider.py -q` -> 69/69 passed.
- Build 5 proof: `python -m pytest tests/test_bifrost_cockpit.py tests/test_cockpit_state.py -q` -> 94/94 passed.
- Combined proof: `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py tests/test_cockpit_provider.py tests/test_bifrost_cockpit.py tests/test_cockpit_state.py -q` -> 163/163 passed.

## Coordinator Addendum - Round B7 Review Scope Queued

2026-05-31 02:58 MDT - Round B7 scope queued by coordinator.

- Build 5: `e1bf9db` V1 configurable progress/proof surface implementation.
- Cadence: this is Build 5's third task-changing commit after `d13f1d1` and `5c89e87`; Build 5 should pause normal implementation until this cadence review clears.
- Files:
  - `bifrost/cockpit.py`
  - `bifrost/static/cockpit.css`
  - `tests/test_bifrost_cockpit.py`
  - `docs/live-build-5.md` for provenance only.
- Required proof:
  - Inspect `git show e1bf9db -- bifrost/cockpit.py bifrost/static/cockpit.css tests/test_bifrost_cockpit.py docs/live-build-5.md`.
  - Run `python -m pytest tests/test_bifrost_cockpit.py tests/test_cockpit_state.py -q`.
  - Confirm progress events remain render-only and deterministic: no queue/log/env/prompt reads, no JavaScript, and no persistence.
  - Confirm category, severity, source, timestamp, summary, and optional drilldown reference are escaped before rendering.
  - Confirm the severity summary/counts and CSS hooks are stable enough for the V1 cockpit UI.
  - Confirm snapshot mapping preserves typed progress category/severity from `PrimeCockpitSnapshot`.
- Output:
  - Declare Round B7 scope.
  - Update Review Ledger, Review Log, Proof Log, Findings, and Repair Routing Log.
  - If clean, mark Build 5 `e1bf9db` passed and clear the Build 5 cadence pause.
  - If actionable findings exist, route repairs to Build 5.
