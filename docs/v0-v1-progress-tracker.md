# Meridian V0/V1 Progress Tracker

**Purpose:** Give Prime, Codex, and Scott a countable progress view. This is the canonical tracker for progress reports: totals first, details second.

**Tracker rule:** Every item is tracked as either a Prime build or a harness build. Do not add loose feature names without naming the owning harness.

## V0 Progress Tracker

**Scope source:** `docs/v0-build-readiness-map.md` gate summary.

| Status | Count | Percent |
|---|---:|---:|
| Built core gate items | 6 | 100% |
| Supporting slices in review | 0 | n/a |
| Needs build core gate items | 0 | 0% |
| Total V0 core gate items | 6 | 100% |

### Built

- [x] **Prime + Mission Boot Harness:** `prime_wake()` CLI - built in `e800c03`; Prime can load mission identity and emit wake status.
- [x] **Prime + Review Console Harness:** `route_to_console()` + `prime_console` / `prime_status` CLI - built in `989366f`, repaired in `9c3e1a3`; Prime can place and show console items.
- [x] **Prime + Review Console Harness:** `prime_approve <item-id>` CLI - implemented across `9d38314` / `d687b7f`; targeted CLI tests pass.
- [x] **Relay Harness:** `relay_executor.py` provider-neutral executor skeleton - built in `190e527`; executor accepts an injected model-call function without vendor code.
- [x] **Relay Harness + Model Harness:** real provider-neutral model/API dispatch path - adapter contract built in `653488b`, registry/dispatch bridge built in `0560eb4`, env-gated HTTP JSON transport built in `869faa4`, hardened in `f353c8d`.
- [x] **Beacon Harness:** `beacon.py` file-backed liveness checks - built in `b575677`; queue/sentinel freshness now produces `Heartbeat` objects.
- [x] **Relay Harness + Aegis Harness:** pre-dispatch proof gate enforcement for tier-3/4 lanes - built in `7c75f43`; blocking proof evidence prevents high-risk dispatch before model calls.

### In Progress / Review

- [x] **Planning Harness + Council:** Council-shaped automated planning harness - built in `2c90247`, grill-with-docs anchor `0f0ecbd`; reviewed and cleared by Codex Reviews A addendum.

### Needs Build

- [x] **Relay Harness:** V0 core model/API dispatch path is built at the provider-neutral HTTP transport level. Vendor-specific endpoint presets and richer response parsing remain post-V0 hardening, not a V0 core gate.

## V0 Review Queue

- [ ] Review A Round 3 - Build 1 `190e527` and Build 2 `d821106`.
- [ ] Review B Round B3 - Build 4 `fd9224d`, Build 5 `a412e90`, and Build 3 FileMap follow-up status.

## V1 Planning Tracker

**V1 definition:** V1 is the cockpit UI release. It turns the V0 CLI/domain capabilities into something Scott can see, steer, and operate. V1 is primarily Bifrost cockpit UI plus wiring existing Meridian capabilities into that UI.

**Explicitly out of V1:** Echo memory engine, Atlas/RAG engine, multi-user/multi-Meridian federation, and public/account adapter strategy. Those remain future capability tracks after the cockpit exists.

| Status | Count | Percent |
|---|---:|---:|
| Built | 13 | 100% |
| In Progress | 0 | 0% |
| Planned / designed | 0 | 0% |
| Needs planning | 0 | 0% |
| Total V1 cockpit items | 13 | 100% |

### Built

- [x] **Bifrost Harness:** first static cockpit scaffold - built in `d13f1d1`.
- [x] **Prime + Bifrost Harness:** cockpit snapshot/event domain shape - built in `f56af55`.
- [x] **Prime + Bifrost Harness:** Prime cockpit snapshot provider/factory - built in `6c9a397`.
- [x] **Bifrost Harness + Prime:** live-data integration contract - built in `56f626d`.
- [x] **Bifrost Harness + Prime:** Bifrost integration sequence - built in `ed0fb75`.
- [x] **Prime + Bifrost Harness:** cockpit-state package API surface - built in `e656027` + `b314b5b`.
- [x] **FileMap Harness:** Prime cockpit provider FileMap registration - built in `c1ba27b`.
- [x] **Prime + Bifrost Harness:** Prime cockpit provider package API surface - built in `14315b3`, cadence closed in `f66bbde`.
- [x] **Bifrost Harness + Prime:** `PrimeCockpitSnapshot` to `CockpitViewModel` mapping - built in `5c89e87`.
- [x] **Bifrost Harness + Prime:** runtime acceptance checklist - built in `ec66081`.
- [x] **Bifrost Harness + Aegis Harness:** configurable progress/proof surface - built in `e1bf9db`; cleared by Reviews B Round B7.
- [x] **Bifrost Harness:** harness dashboard implementation - built in `9328272`; cleared by Reviews B Round B8.
- [x] **Bifrost Harness:** openable Electron cockpit app shell - built in Build 5 and corrected in `05a108f1`; `npm start` launches the Meridian Electron UI via `electron/main.js`, which loads root `index.html` as the renderer with context isolation, sandbox, and remote-navigation blocking. `bifrost/preview.html` remains generated backend/view-model proof output only.

### In Progress

- [x] None. V1 cockpit build items are implemented and review-cleared.

### Planned / Designed

- [x] None. V1's final planned item is now assigned.

### Needs Planning

- [x] **Bifrost Harness:** V1 cockpit scope is locked enough to build; V2 planning can start after the active V1 wiring wave lands.

## Reporting Format

Every progress report should begin with:

```text
V0: <built>/<total> built (<percent>), <in_progress> in progress/review, <remaining> left.
V1: <built>/<total> built (<percent>), <planned> planned/designed, <unplanned> still needs planning.
```

Then list:

- Built
- In Progress
- Needs Build
- Review Queue
- Blockers/Risks
- Next Coordinator Action

When listing items, prefix each with the owner:

- **Prime**
- **Bifrost Harness**
- **Relay Harness**
- **Aegis Harness**
- **Beacon Harness**
- **Compass Harness**
- **Review Console Harness**
- **Echo Harness**
- **Atlas Harness**
- **Model Harness**
- **Session Lifecycle Harness**
- **Federation Harness**

## V2 Progress Tracker

**V2 tracking:** For V2 progress reporting, totals, and per-harness build status, see **`docs/v2-progress-tracker.md`** — the canonical V2 progress tracker.

**V2 direction by owner:** Prime Autonomy, Echo Harness memory, Atlas Harness retrieval, Relay/Model Harness hardening, Aegis gated cognition, Session Lifecycle Harness, Bifrost V2 extensions, and eventual Federation Harness.

**Detailed V2 build plan:** `docs/v2-detailed-build-plan.md`
