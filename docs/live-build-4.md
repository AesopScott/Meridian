# Live Build 4 Queue

## Required First Command For Every New Task

You must do all work inside your assigned unique worktree. You are not allowed to write to `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian` main or push/write to `main` without explicit coordinator approval. Do not move data between worktrees, branches, or the main checkout. Do not cherry-pick, copy files, stash-pop across worktrees, merge, rebase, reset, or salvage. If you believe work must move, stop and ask the coordinator. The coordinator may permit it only after verifying `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian` main is clean.

## Queue Authority

Only the first `Coordinator Override - Active Now` block in this file is executable. Lower archived/stale active-task sections are historical context only and must not be executed unless Prime/Codex promotes them back to the top of the file.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: repair cadence-3/3 self-review finding — raw-context payload in `subject_ref` or `ambiguity_reason` was being interpolated into `compass_question` on the scope-layer AMBIGUOUS branch.

Worktree: `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\build-4-compass-project-definition`.

Branch: `codex/build-4-compass-project-definition-20260606` (pushed to origin at `db5b423e3` on 2026-06-06).

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/compass.py`, `tests/test_compass.py`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

Task:
- Cadence-3/3 Codex review attempt on the 5-commit Compass repair series (`cc584318f^..5aa4e4b30`) hit the monthly spend limit again. Heartbeat self-review found a fourth real leak parallel to the prior three: `evaluate_project_scope` only scanned `candidate.evidence_refs`; a caller could put a raw-context payload into `candidate.subject_ref` or `candidate.ambiguity_reason` and the AMBIGUOUS branch would interpolate it into `compass_question`, leaking the raw payload into `to_dict()` output.
- Repair extends the scope-layer guard to scan `subject_ref` and `ambiguity_reason`, returning BLOCKED with `subject_ref` and `evidence_refs` redacted before any `compass_question` interpolation can run.

Completion: 2026-06-06 (Opus build lane, cadence-3/3 self-review repair).

Ready for Codex Review:

- Repair commit: `95dde4d50` (Repair Compass scope-layer subject_ref/ambiguity_reason raw-context leak).
- Branch marker commit: `db5b423e3` (Mark Compass scope-layer subject-field redaction repair ready for Codex review).
- Branch HEAD pushed: `origin/codex/build-4-compass-project-definition-20260606` at `db5b423e3` (2026-06-06).
- Files changed: `meridian_core/compass.py` (+22 lines: second raw-context guard at the top of `evaluate_project_scope` that builds the BLOCKED `ProjectScopeEvaluation` directly with `subject_ref` and `evidence_refs` redacted), `tests/test_compass.py` (+184 lines: new `TestProjectScopeSubjectFieldRawContextGuard` class with 20 cases), `docs/live-build-4.md` (branch + main markers).
- Tests run: `python -m pytest tests/test_compass.py -q` -> **283 passed** (20 new subject-field guard tests on top of 263 prior).
- `git diff --check`: clean.
- Reproducer (before fix): `ProjectScopeCandidate(project_id='meridian-v2', subject_kind='ambiguous', subject_ref='raw_prompt:secret subject content', evidence_refs=('proof:safe',), ambiguity_reason='reason text')` → `evaluate_project_scope` returned `AMBIGUOUS` with `compass_question` containing the raw subject_ref verbatim; `json.dumps(result.to_dict())` contained `secret subject content`.
- After fix: same call returns `BLOCKED` with blocker `raw_context_subject_field_blocked`, `subject_ref="<redacted_raw_context>"`, `compass_question=None`. No raw payload anywhere in JSON.
- Concrete evidence each required invariant is enforced:
  - Raw payload absent from serialization across 9 parametrized raw-context prefixes on `subject_ref`: `test_raw_context_in_subject_ref_blocks_and_redacts`.
  - Same for 6 parametrized prefixes on `ambiguity_reason`: `test_raw_context_in_ambiguity_reason_blocks_and_redacts` (ambiguity_reason is not a serialized result field, so the assertion verifies raw text absent from JSON and `compass_question=None`).
  - Guard runs regardless of subject_kind: `test_raw_context_in_subject_ref_independent_of_subject_kind` (known `artifact` subject_kind also blocks).
  - Precedence documented: `test_raw_context_in_both_subject_ref_and_evidence_refs_blocks` shows evidence_refs guard fires first; a retry with safe evidence triggers the new subject_ref guard which redacts.
  - Regression: safe `subject_ref` + safe `ambiguity_reason` still reach AMBIGUOUS with interpolated compass_question.
  - Regression: safe candidate still reaches IN_SCOPE.
  - Stable serialization: `test_scope_blocked_subject_field_serializes_stably` asserts `tuple(result.to_dict().keys()) == project_scope_result_dict_keys()`.
- Pure backend behavior preserved: no model/provider calls, no UI/Bifrost/FileMap edits, no branch/worktree movement, no shared-main writes (beyond this queue marker), no Polaris dependency.
- Next Candidate: pending coordinator promotion after this scope-layer subject-field redaction repair clears Codex review. Independent Codex review still owed for `cc584318f` + `cd20be9c3` + `270438271` + `df8120b49` + `808297315` + `95dde4d50` once Codex CLI spend limit is raised.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: repair Codex Review B finding on Compass project-identity blocked path — raw-context evidence_refs were detected and blocked but not redacted in serialization.

Worktree: `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\build-4-compass-project-definition`.

Branch: `codex/build-4-compass-project-definition-20260606` (pushed to origin at `5aa4e4b30` on 2026-06-06).

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/compass.py`, `tests/test_compass.py`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

Task:
- Repair `evaluate_project_identity()` raw-context BLOCKED path so `evidence_refs` are redacted with the same `_redact_raw_context_refs` pattern used by scope (cd20be9c3) and difference (df8120b49) layers before serialization.
- Preserve safe evidence refs, existing blockers, status, and `execution_authorized=False` behavior.
- Add regression tests proving raw evidence refs are blocked AND redacted in `ProjectIdentityEvaluation.to_dict()`, while safe refs pass.

Completion: 2026-06-06 (Opus build lane).

Ready for Codex Review:

- Repair commit: `808297315` (Repair Compass identity-layer raw-context evidence_refs leak (Codex Review B)).
- Branch marker commit: `5aa4e4b30` (Mark Compass identity-layer raw-context redaction repair ready for Codex review).
- Branch HEAD pushed: `origin/codex/build-4-compass-project-definition-20260606` at `5aa4e4b30` (2026-06-06).
- Files changed: `meridian_core/compass.py` (1 line: route `candidate.evidence_refs` through `_redact_raw_context_refs` when constructing the BLOCKED `ProjectIdentityEvaluation`), `tests/test_compass.py` (+134 lines: new `TestProjectIdentityRawContextRedaction` class with 15 cases), `docs/live-build-4.md` (branch marker).
- Tests run: `python -m pytest tests/test_compass.py -q` -> **263 passed** (15 new identity-redaction tests on top of 248 prior).
- `git diff --check`: clean.
- Reproducer (before fix): `evaluate_project_identity(_identity_candidate(evidence_refs=("raw_prompt:secret prompt body",))).to_dict()["evidence_refs"]` returned `("raw_prompt:secret prompt body",)` — the raw payload appeared verbatim in JSON output. The existing `test_raw_context_evidence_ref_is_blocked` only checked blocker presence, not redaction, so it passed under the leaky implementation.
- After fix: same call returns `("<redacted_raw_context>",)` and `json.dumps` no longer contains `secret prompt body`.
- Concrete evidence each required invariant is enforced:
  - Raw payload absent from serialization: 9 parametrized prefixes (`raw_prompt`, `raw_transcript`, `free_form_context`, `transcript`, `conversation`, `provider_response`, `raw_context`, `prompt`, embedded-newline) in `test_raw_context_evidence_ref_redacted_in_blocked_serialization` all assert raw text absent from both `result.evidence_refs` and `json.dumps(result.to_dict())` while `<redacted_raw_context>` appears in both.
  - Mixed safe/raw evidence preserves safe refs in original order and redacts raw refs in place: `test_mixed_safe_and_raw_evidence_refs_partially_redacted`.
  - Redaction does NOT over-trigger on other BLOCKED paths: `test_safe_evidence_refs_pass_through_unchanged_on_other_blocker_paths` (missing_project_id path with safe evidence refs preserves the original tuple).
  - Safe evidence still reaches DEFINED: `test_safe_evidence_refs_still_define_project_identity`.
  - Multi-blocker path: `test_existing_identity_blockers_preserved_alongside_redaction` confirms `missing_title` + `raw_context_evidence_ref_blocked` coexist with redaction still applied.
  - Stable serialization: `test_blocked_redacted_result_serializes_stably` asserts `tuple(result.to_dict().keys()) == project_identity_result_dict_keys()`.
  - `execution_authorized=False` preserved: `test_execution_never_authorized_on_redacted_blocked_path`.
- Pure backend behavior preserved: no model/provider calls, no UI/Bifrost/FileMap edits, no branch/worktree movement, no shared-main writes (beyond this queue marker), no Polaris dependency.
- Next Candidate: pending coordinator promotion after this identity-layer redaction repair clears Codex review.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: implement Compass Project Difference Runtime (coordinator-promoted after Codex Review B passed identity + bounds/scope runtimes).

Worktree: `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\build-4-compass-project-definition`.

Branch: `codex/build-4-compass-project-definition-20260606` (pushed to origin at `2201b6d4c` on 2026-06-06 — includes cadence-3/3 self-review repair).

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/compass.py`, `tests/test_compass.py`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

Task:
- Distinguish projects by mission/bearing, objectives, artifacts, memory pins, blockers, proof expectations, and relationship refs; same repo or venture must NOT imply same project.
- Surface uncertain or insufficient evidence as Compass questions/blockers rather than silently merging.
- Always serialize `execution_authorized=False`.
- Block/redact raw prompt/transcript/free-form context/provider-response evidence refs.
- Pure backend: no model calls, no UI/Bifrost/FileMap edits, no branch/worktree movement, no shared-main writes, no Polaris dependency.

Completion: 2026-06-06 (Opus build lane).

Ready for Codex Review:

- Implementation commit: `270438271` (Add Compass Project Difference Runtime raw-context guard + execution_authorized).
- Branch marker commit: `3ba2d976c` (Mark Compass Project Difference Runtime ready for Codex review).
- Cadence 3/3 self-review repair commit: `df8120b49` (Repair Compass Difference Runtime shared_relationship_refs raw-context leak).
- Branch marker repair commit: `2201b6d4c` (Update branch queue marker with Difference Runtime self-review repair).
- Branch HEAD pushed: `origin/codex/build-4-compass-project-definition-20260606` at `2201b6d4c` (2026-06-06).
- Files changed across slice + repair: `meridian_core/compass.py` (+77 lines total), `tests/test_compass.py` (+277 lines total), `docs/live-build-4.md` (branch marker, two updates).
- Tests run: `python -m pytest tests/test_compass.py -q` -> **248 passed** (39 new tests + 1 updated existing test on top of 208 prior).
- `git diff --check`: clean.
- Path-scope check: implementation diff limited to `meridian_core/compass.py` and `tests/test_compass.py`; only the branch-side `docs/live-build-4.md` queue marker block changed there. This main-side block is the only `docs/live-build-4.md` change in shared main this turn.
- Concrete evidence each required invariant is enforced:
  - Distinct projects on bounded bearing fields, not on shared envelope: existing `test_same_repo_does_not_imply_same_project` and `test_same_venture_does_not_imply_same_project` continue to pass; new regression guards `test_shared_repo_does_not_imply_same_project_under_raw_guard` and `test_shared_venture_does_not_imply_same_project_under_raw_guard` confirm the new raw-context guard did not change that behavior. `test_visible_difference_evidence_covers_all_requested_fields` still proves all six required difference fields (mission_bearing, objectives, artifacts, memory_pins, blockers, proof_expectations) are surfaced.
  - Uncertain/insufficient evidence surfaces as Compass questions/blockers: `test_missing_left_project_id_blocks`, `test_missing_right_project_id_blocks`, `test_missing_difference_evidence_refs_blocks`, `test_missing_left_required_fields_block`, `test_missing_right_required_fields_block`, `test_same_project_id_without_evidence_returns_same_project`, and `test_no_difference_evidence_but_distinct_project_ids_returns_ambiguous` all continue to pass.
  - `execution_authorized=False` now serialized on every decision branch: `_PROJECT_DIFFERENCE_RESULT_DICT_KEYS` extended with `execution_authorized`; `test_execution_never_authorized_across_difference_branches` parametrizes over DISTINCT / SAME_PROJECT / raw-blocked / missing-blocked confirming `payload["execution_authorized"] is False` and `payload["merge_authorized"] is False` on each. `test_difference_runtime_does_not_emit_cross_project_handoff_fields` updated from its prior (now-inverted) assertion to require `execution_authorized=False`.
  - Block/redact raw context evidence refs: new `_project_difference_raw_context_blockers` helper + raw-context branch in `evaluate_project_difference` returns BLOCKED with `_redact_raw_context_refs` swap; 8 parametrized raw-context prefix tests (`raw_prompt`, `raw_transcript`, `free_form_context`, `transcript`, `conversation`, `provider_response`, `raw_context`, embedded-newline) confirm the BLOCK + redaction marker `<redacted_raw_context>` + `merge_authorized=False` + `execution_authorized=False`; 6 parametrized JSON-encoded serialization tests assert raw payload absent from `json.dumps` output.
  - Self-review repair `df8120b49`: `shared_relationship_refs` ALSO redacted on the raw-context BLOCKED branch. The original implementation computed `_shared_relationship_refs(left, right)` BEFORE the raw-context guard and preserved any raw payload that both sides smuggled through the same repo_refs/venture_refs entry (e.g. `repo_refs=("raw_prompt:smuggled",)` on both sides). `test_shared_relationship_refs_redacted_when_raw_context_shared` and `test_shared_relationship_refs_redacted_when_raw_context_shared_via_venture` regression-guard the fix; raw payload now absent from `json.dumps` output across both repo_refs and venture_refs leak paths.
  - Defense-in-depth on profile fields: 14 parametrized side+field tests (left/right × objectives/artifacts/memory_pins/blockers/proof_expectations/repo_refs/venture_refs) each block with side+field-specific blocker name and no raw payload in JSON. Left and right `mission_bearing` each blocked via dedicated tests.
  - Ordering invariant: `test_raw_context_guard_runs_before_required_field_blockers` confirms the raw-context guard short-circuits BEFORE missing-field blockers so an incomplete profile cannot leak raw payload through the missing-field branch.
  - Multi-site aggregation: `test_multiple_raw_context_sites_aggregate_into_blockers` confirms all raw-context sites surface in one pass.
  - Stable serialization preserved: `test_raw_context_blocked_result_serializes_stably` asserts `tuple(result.to_dict().keys()) == project_difference_result_dict_keys()` for the BLOCKED branch under the extended dict_keys shape.
- Pure backend behavior preserved: no model/provider calls, no UI/Bifrost/FileMap edits, no branch/worktree movement, no shared-main writes (beyond this queue marker), no raw cross-project transcript injection, no Polaris dependency.
- Next Candidate: pending coordinator promotion after Compass Project Difference Runtime review clears.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: implement Compass project bounds/scope runtime as the next backend boundary slice (Next Candidate after project identity review).

Worktree: `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\build-4-compass-project-definition`.

Branch: `codex/build-4-compass-project-definition-20260606` (pushed to origin at `c6c3fdff7` on 2026-06-06).

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/compass.py`, `tests/test_compass.py`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

Task:
- Extend the deterministic Compass backend with a project bounds/scope runtime that builds on the reviewed project identity runtime.
- Model bounded project scope using outcome, context, artifacts, objectives, tasks, proof trail, and repo/venture/session relationships.
- Distinguish in-scope vs out-of-scope requests; surface ambiguous or incomplete scope as Compass questions/blockers.
- Preserve shared repo/venture/session boundaries (do not collapse them silently).
- Always serialize `execution_authorized=False`.
- Pure backend: no model calls, no UI/Bifrost/FileMap edits, no branch/worktree movement, no shared-main writes, no raw cross-project transcript injection, no Polaris dependency.

Completion: 2026-06-06 (Opus build lane).

Ready for Codex Review:

- Implementation commit: `3a7f3af29` (Add Compass project bounds runtime).
- Branch marker commit: `c6c3fdff7` (Mark Compass project bounds runtime ready for Codex review).
- Cadence 3/3 self-review repair commit: `cc584318f` (Repair Compass bounds runtime raw-context candidate evidence gap at request layer).
- Branch marker repair commit: `c727381d6` (Update branch queue marker with bounds runtime self-review repair).
- Codex Review B repair commit: `cd20be9c3` (Repair Compass scope-layer raw-context bypass — direct callers of evaluate_project_scope no longer accept or serialize raw-context evidence_refs; redaction marker `<redacted_raw_context>` swaps in for raw refs).
- Codex Review B branch marker commit: `c3c81c037` (Update branch queue marker with Codex Review B scope-layer repair).
- Branch HEAD pushed: `origin/codex/build-4-compass-project-definition-20260606` at `c3c81c037` (2026-06-06).
- Files changed across the slice + repairs: `meridian_core/compass.py` (+536 lines total), `tests/test_compass.py` (+602 lines total), `docs/live-build-4.md` (branch marker, three updates).
- Tests run: `python -m pytest tests/test_compass.py -q` -> **208 passed** (29 bounds runtime tests + 6 bounds-layer parametrized raw-context tests + 21 scope-layer parametrized raw-context tests on top of 152 prior).
- `git diff --check`: clean.
- Path-scope check: implementation diff limited to `meridian_core/compass.py` and `tests/test_compass.py`; only the branch-side `docs/live-build-4.md` queue marker block changed there.
- Concrete evidence the bounds runtime proves the required invariants:
  - New `ProjectBoundsDecision` enum (`IN_SCOPE`, `OUT_OF_SCOPE`, `PARTIAL_SCOPE`, `AMBIGUOUS`, `BLOCKED`).
  - New frozen `ProjectBoundsRequest` bundles a tuple of `ProjectScopeCandidate` subjects with the relationship envelope (`repo_refs`, `venture_refs`, `session_refs`), `evidence_refs`, `request_kind`, `request_ref`, and optional `ambiguity_reason`.
  - New frozen `ProjectBoundsEvaluation` always serializes `execution_authorized=False`; stable key order via `project_bounds_result_dict_keys()`.
  - `evaluate_project_bounds(project, request)` builds on the reviewed identity runtime by requiring the request's `project_id` to match the reviewed `ProjectDefinition`, then runs each candidate through `evaluate_project_scope` and aggregates per-subject decisions deterministically.
  - In/out/mixed scope decisions: `test_all_in_scope_subjects_return_in_scope`, `test_all_out_of_scope_subjects_return_out_of_scope`, `test_mixed_subjects_return_partial_scope`.
  - Ambiguous/incomplete surfaces as Compass question: `test_unknown_request_kind_returns_compass_question`, `test_explicit_ambiguous_request_kind_returns_compass_question`, `test_ambiguous_subject_returns_compass_question`.
  - Hidden context is blocked: `test_missing_request_project_id_blocks`, `test_project_identity_mismatch_blocks`, `test_empty_candidates_blocks`, `test_missing_evidence_refs_blocks`, `test_raw_context_evidence_ref_blocks`, `test_blocked_subject_blocks_bounds`. Repair: `test_raw_context_in_candidate_evidence_refs_blocks` parametrized over 6 raw-context prefixes confirms the new `raw_context_candidate_evidence_ref_blocked` guard (added in `cc584318f` after self-review caught that raw-context refs hidden inside per-candidate `evidence_refs` had been bypassing the request-level guard). Codex Review B repair `cd20be9c3` extends the guard down into the scope layer itself: `evaluate_project_scope` now fails closed with `raw_context_evidence_ref_blocked` and redacts each raw ref to `"<redacted_raw_context>"` so direct scope callers no longer return IN_SCOPE with a raw payload preserved in serialization. `TestProjectScopeRawContextGuard` (21 tests) covers 9 parametrized raw-context prefixes plus newline embedding, mixed safe/raw evidence preservation, safe-only IN_SCOPE regression, safe out-of-scope regression, bounds-layer defense-in-depth pairing, raw-context-guard-precedes-subject-matching ordering, and json-encoded redaction safety.
  - Shared repo/venture/session preserved, not collapsed: `test_shared_repo_venture_session_surfaced_not_collapsed`, `test_non_shared_envelope_does_not_surface_shared_refs`.
  - `execution_authorized=False` across all 5 decision branches: `test_execution_is_never_authorized_across_branches`.
  - No identity/handoff/scope/raw-context field bleed: `test_bounds_runtime_does_not_emit_identity_or_handoff_fields`, `test_bounds_runtime_does_not_emit_raw_context_keys`.
  - Per-candidate decisions recorded for auditability: `test_candidate_decisions_record_per_subject_outcomes`.
  - Public surface exposed via `evaluate_project_bounds`, `project_bounds_request_dict_keys`, `project_bounds_result_dict_keys`, and `project_bounds_request_kinds` (frozen set of known request kinds).
- Pure backend behavior preserved: no model/provider calls, no UI/Bifrost/FileMap edits, no branch/worktree movement, no shared-main writes, no raw cross-project transcript injection, no Polaris dependency.
- Next Candidate: pending coordinator promotion after Compass project bounds review clears.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: implement Compass project definition runtime as the next backend boundary slice.

Worktree: `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\build-4-compass-project-definition`.

Branch: `codex/build-4-compass-project-definition-20260606` (pushed to origin 2026-06-06).

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/compass.py`, `tests/test_compass.py`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

Task:
- Add or complete deterministic Compass domain objects/helpers for project identity as a bounded body of work with outcome, context, artifacts, objectives, tasks, proof trail, and relationship to repo/venture/session.
- Prove project identity does not collapse merely because two projects share a repo path, venture, or session label.
- Surface ambiguous or incomplete project identity as a Compass question/blocker rather than silently selecting hidden context.
- Preserve pure backend behavior: no model calls, no UI/Bifrost/FileMap edits, no branch/worktree movement, no shared-main write, no raw cross-project transcript injection, and no Polaris dependency.

Completion: 2026-06-06 (Opus repair lane; Codex Review B repair applied).

Ready for Codex Review:

- Implementation commit: `a5e2bd048` (Add Compass project identity runtime).
- Codex Review B repair commit: `0a92221a` (Repair Compass project identity bearing normalization + bounded evidence).
- Branch HEAD: `358c496ee` (Update queue marker with Codex Review B repair commit hash).
- Branch pushed: `origin/codex/build-4-compass-project-definition-20260606` at `358c496ee` (2026-06-06 18:58 UTC).
- Files changed across the branch: `meridian_core/compass.py`, `tests/test_compass.py`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.
- Tests run: `python -m pytest tests/test_compass.py -q` -> **152 passed** (97 baseline + 33 identity runtime + 22 Codex Review B repair).
- `git diff --check`: clean.
- Path-scope vs `origin/main` base `3b7bae9f2`: only the three allowed files touched.
- Concrete evidence the identity runtime proves the required invariants:
  - `ProjectDefinition`, `ProjectRelationshipRefs`, and `define_project()` continue to bound a project by `outcome`, `context`, `artifacts`, `objectives`, `tasks`, `proof_trail`, and `relationship_refs` (repo/venture/session).
  - `evaluate_project_identity()` accepts a `ProjectIdentityCandidate` plus `ProjectIdentityNeighbor` profiles and returns a `ProjectIdentityEvaluation` whose decision is `DEFINED`, `AMBIGUOUS`, or `BLOCKED`. `to_dict()` always serializes `execution_authorized=False`.
  - Identity does NOT collapse on shared refs: `test_shared_repo_with_distinct_bearing_stays_defined`, `test_shared_venture_with_distinct_bearing_stays_defined`, `test_shared_session_with_distinct_bearing_stays_defined`.
  - Identity collapse risk surfaces as a Compass question, not silent merge: `test_shared_refs_with_same_bearing_collapse_returns_compass_question`, `test_same_project_id_neighbor_collapses`, and repair `test_all_bounded_fields_matching_truly_collapses`.
  - Incomplete identity blocked, not silently selected: `test_missing_{project_id,title,outcome,mission_bearing,repo_refs,venture_refs,evidence_refs}_is_blocked`, `test_raw_context_evidence_ref_is_blocked`.
- Codex Review B findings addressed by repair commit `0a92221a`:
  - Finding 1 (bearing normalization): `_normalize_bearing_text()` lowercases, collapses whitespace runs, and strips leading/trailing punctuation before comparing candidate and neighbor mission bearings. `TestProjectIdentityBearingNormalization.test_normalized_bearing_collisions_return_ambiguous` covers 6 parametrized variants returning `AMBIGUOUS`; `test_distinct_bearing_after_normalization_stays_defined` proves real differences still distinguish.
  - Finding 2 (richer bounded identity evidence): `ProjectIdentityNeighbor` and `ProjectIdentityCandidate` now carry optional `title`, `outcome`, `context`, `artifacts`, `objectives`, `tasks`, `proof_trail`. `_bounded_identity_distinguishes()` compares only fields populated on both sides (text via same normalization; tuples as order-insensitive sets). `project_identity_candidate_from_definition()` forwards the bounded body of work from `ProjectDefinition`. `TestProjectIdentityBoundedDistinction` covers each bounded field keeping neighbors distinct under bearing collision plus the all-match collapse case and partial-data edges.
- Pure backend behavior preserved: no model/provider calls, no UI/Bifrost/FileMap edits, no branch/worktree movement during evaluation, no raw cross-project transcript injection, no Polaris dependency.
- Next Candidate: Compass bounds/scope runtime after project definition review clears.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: add Aegis V3 Goal Runtime checkpoint discipline advisory gate.

Worktree: `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\build-4-aegis`.

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/aegis.py`, `tests/test_aegis.py`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

Task: add a pure Aegis advisory evaluator for V3 Goal Runtime checkpoint discipline. Accept summarized inputs for goal objective presence, active owner/lane, last Git checkpoint, last Obsidian checkpoint, checkpoint cadence state, token/time budget status, review/lease gate refs, blocker policy, and proof refs; return bounded display/review metadata only with `execution_authorized=False` and no self-approval. Exclude actual Git/Obsidian operations, automation creation, filesystem movement, UI/Bifrost/Relay/Session/FileMap edits, provider/model calls, shared-main writes, and Polaris.

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/compass.py`, `tests/test_compass.py`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

Task: extend Compass backend logic to model safe cross-project communication after Project Definition, Bounds/Scope, and Project Difference. Model source project, target project, reason category, payload type, evidence refs, approval need, and blocked raw context bleed; require distinct source/target project identities and evidence refs before handoff review; preserve project-difference boundaries when repo or venture refs are shared; keep raw prompts/transcripts/free-form context out of serialized evidence refs and payload summaries. Keep it advisory/review-only and exclude session retargeting, UI/Bifrost/FileMap/package export, Relay/model/provider calls, network/filesystem scanning, branch/worktree movement, shared main writes, and Polaris.

Tests: `python -m pytest tests/test_compass.py -q`.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: convert the deepened Relay harness model-selection logic into an implementation checklist.

Worktree: `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\build-4-aegis`.

Required first command for this task: verify you are in your assigned unique worktree and not in `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian`; you are not allowed to write to main, move data between worktrees or branches, cherry-pick, copy files, stash-pop across worktrees, merge, rebase, reset, or salvage without coordinator approval.

Task: turn the reviewed Relay model/vendor/session routing logic into a build-ready implementation checklist. Include account-first routing, wrong-scope correction/blocking, API/direct/aggregator fallback gates, exact model id requirements, dual-model and external-review triggers, session lifecycle start/summarize/reset/transfer/archive decisions, cost/token/rate-limit/account exhaustion handling, block conditions, Bifrost visibility requirements, and tests/proofs needed before runtime routing is allowed. Keep this docs-only; do not edit runtime code, tests, FileMap, Bifrost UI, model/account/process code, branches, or Polaris.

- Next Candidate: bind any review findings from the implementation checklist before further Relay routing implementation.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: repair the Relay routing implementation checklist EOF whitespace finding from Codex Reviews B.

Allowed files only: `docs/relay-heartbeat-model-routing-implementation-checklist.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

## Next Candidate Task

Goal: bind any Codex review findings from the Relay routing implementation checklist.

Allowed files only: `docs/relay-heartbeat-model-routing-implementation-checklist.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

Task: if Codex Reviews B routes a finding from the checklist review, repair that finding before taking unrelated Relay/Aegis work. If Reviews B passes the slice with no findings, Prime may replace this candidate with the next Relay/Model Harness item from `docs/v2-progress-tracker.md`.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: repair remaining account-first wrong-scope fallback contradiction from Codex Reviews B.

Allowed files only: `docs/relay-heartbeat-model-routing-logic.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

Task: update `docs/relay-heartbeat-model-routing-logic.md` directly so the account-first decision tree no longer allows wrong project, wrong role, or wrong tools to fall through the generic "rejected at any step" API/aggregator fallback. Keep the existing Step 2 rule that wrong scope must start a project-specific or role-matched controllable session, and make the generic rejection handling explicitly exclude wrong scope/tool mismatches unless a later table row allows the route. Wrong project/role/tools must start a corrected session or block; they must not silently bypass into direct API or aggregator.

Completion: completed 2026-06-12 07:40 UTC.

Ready for Codex Review:

- Commit: `381080fa` (pushed to origin/main as `fe0b0138` after rebase)
- Files changed: `docs/relay-heartbeat-model-routing-logic.md`
- Tests: not required (docs-only)
- Repair applied:
  1. **Separated wrong-scope rejection handling:** Added explicit "Special case" section that prevents wrong project/role/tools rejections from falling through to API/aggregator fallback (lines 168-170)
  2. **Clarified other rejections path:** Kept original fallback logic for Steps 1, 3, 4 rejections (lines 172-176)
  3. **Preserved Step 2 rule:** Existing Step 2 rule intact (line 156) - wrong scope must start corrected session
- Verification: Contradiction resolved - Step 2 rule and generic rejection handling now aligned
- Ready for Codex Review; awaiting sweep

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: repair remaining Relay routing logic consistency findings from Codex Reviews B.

Allowed files only: `docs/relay-heartbeat-model-routing-logic.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

Task: update `docs/relay-heartbeat-model-routing-logic.md` directly so it matches the Model Harness exact-id registry rule and removes the still-present routing contradictions. Required repairs:

- Fix the account-first decision tree Step 2 so wrong project, wrong role, or wrong tools starts a project-specific/role-matched session or blocks; it must not fall through to direct API or aggregator as a wrong-scope bypass.
- Fix the explicit fallback table so Tier 3+ account/session missing or expired no longer shows "Try direct API" while also saying "wait for auth" without the required proof/control distinction. State the allowed Tier 3+ choices clearly: start/re-auth a controllable session, use direct API only when direct proof/audit is explicitly required and credentials are valid, or block.
- Fix the DeepSeek route table/preferred routing rows so `deepseek-chat` is the exact direct API dispatch id per Model Harness and handoff; do not describe it as a deprecated compatibility alias while also using it as the normative exact id. Marketing labels such as `deepseek-v4-pro`/`deepseek-v4-flash` may be described only as labels or registry metadata, not dispatch keys.

Completion: completed 2026-06-01 17:42 -06:00.

Ready for Codex Review:

- Commit: `f4d773b0` (pushed to origin/main)
- Files changed: `docs/relay-heartbeat-model-routing-logic.md`
- Tests: not required (docs-only)
- Repairs applied and verified:
  1. **Account-First Decision Tree Step 2:** Updated to "Start project-specific or role-matched session (wrong scope must be corrected, not bypassed)"
  2. **Explicit API Fallback Conditions:** Tier 3+ row updated to show "✓ (start/re-auth session, or direct API if proof/audit explicit)" for account missing/expired
  3. **DeepSeek Dispatch ID:** Clarified in line 116: "The dispatch ID for direct API calls is `deepseek-chat`; `v4-pro` and `v4-flash` are marketing/capability variants expressed as metadata, not dispatch keys."
- Verification: All three consistency contradictions repaired and verified in place
- Ready for Codex Review; awaiting sweep

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: repair Relay harness model-selection logic consistency findings from Codex Reviews B.

Allowed files only: `docs/relay-heartbeat-model-routing-logic.md`, `docs/model-harness-v2-contract.md`, `docs/deepseek-direct-provider-implementation-handoff.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

Task: make the deepened Relay routing docs internally consistent without broad rewrites. Required repairs:

- Resolve the Tier 3+ account/API fallback contradiction: `docs/relay-heartbeat-model-routing-logic.md` says Tier 3 may use direct APIs when account/session routes cannot satisfy proof/control needs, but its explicit fallback table blocks Tier 3+ when the account session is missing/expired. Define when Tier 3+ should start a clean account/session, use direct API, or block.
- Resolve the wrong-project/wrong-role session branch: the account-first decision tree currently sends a wrong session scope to direct API or aggregator, while the later fallback table says wrong project must start a project-specific session and aggregator is not safe for authoritative/high-risk work. Ensure wrong project/role/session-scope rejection starts a proper session or blocks before any API/aggregator fallback.
- Align exact model identity across the Relay routing doc, Model Harness V2 contract, and DeepSeek handoff. The Relay routing doc names Claude/OpenAI/DeepSeek route families such as `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `GPT-5.3-Codex`, `deepseek-v4-pro`, and `deepseek-v4-flash`, while the metadata contract and DeepSeek handoff still use older normative exact ids such as `gpt-4o` and `deepseek-chat`; `deepseek-chat` is also described as a compatibility alias that should not be chosen for new routes. Decide whether these are placeholders, aliases, or exact runtime ids and document the registry resolution rule.

Completion: completed in commit `a5144d42` and routed to Reviews B for the focused Relay routing logic consistency repair review. Files changed: `docs/relay-heartbeat-model-routing-logic.md`, `docs/model-harness-v2-contract.md`. Tests not required because this is docs-only. No runtime/model-call/account-probing/process-control/UI/branch/Polaris changes were intended in this slice.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: deepen the Relay harness model-selection logic for Prime-led orchestration.

Allowed files only: `docs/relay-heartbeat-model-routing-logic.md`, `docs/relay-completeness-audit.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

Task: expand the architecture logic so Prime can decide which model/vendor/session path to use without missing important gates. Include account-first CLI/session use before paid API fallback, explicit API fallback conditions, Anthropic/OpenAI/OpenRouter/DeepSeek direct roles, when dual-model or external Codex review is required, when to start a new session because context is filling or reasoning/work type shifts, when to summarize/reset/transfer/archive, how cost/token/rate-limit/account exhaustion changes the route, and what must block rather than guess.

Completion: 2026-06-01 17:42 UTC

Ready for Codex Review:

- Commit: `b5c40b38` (pushed to origin/main)
- Files changed: `docs/relay-heartbeat-model-routing-logic.md` (+249 lines)
- Tests: not required (docs-only)
- Expansions applied:
  1. **Account-First Fallback Decision Tree:** 4-step decision process evaluating account/session routes before API fallback
  2. **Explicit API Fallback Conditions:** Tier-aware table showing when fallback allowed, blockers, and fallback actions
  3. **Vendor-Specific Fallback Roles:** Distinct fallback authority and blocking conditions for Anthropic, OpenAI, DeepSeek, OpenRouter
  4. **Dual-Model and External Review Requirements:** When Tier 3+ requires independent lanes, optional for Tier 2, Codex review triggers
  5. **Session Lifecycle Decisions:** Detailed decision points for reuse, new, summarize/reset, transfer, archive with specific triggers
  6. **Cost/Token/Account Exhaustion Routing Changes:** Dynamic routing tables for cost pressure, token budget, account exhaustion, rate limits
  7. **Critical Blockers:** 16 conditions where Relay must block rather than guess (risk tier unknown, proof missing, Aegis gate missing, etc.)
- Proof: All 7 sections added with explicit decision trees, tables, vendor-specific guidance; deepened routing ready for Prime decision-making
- Ready for Codex Review; awaiting sweep

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: repair Aegis-to-Relay summary handoff contract field-shape mismatches found by Codex Reviews B.

Allowed files only: `docs/aegis-relay-summary-handoff-contract.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

Task: update `docs/aegis-relay-summary-handoff-contract.md` so its documented shapes match current `meridian_core/aegis.py` and Relay boundaries exactly. Required repairs:

- `ApprovalRecord.expiration` must be documented as `str | None = None`, not `str = ""`.
- `WaiverRecord.expiration` must be documented as `str | None = None`, and `WaiverRecord.evidence_url: str | None = None` must be included.
- `GateSummary.waiver_approval_status` values must match runtime strings: `none`, `waiver_present`, `approval_present`, and `waiver_approval_missing`.
- Clarify that Aegis summary helpers are pure and do not call models/accounts; Relay's execution boundary may call injected adapters/model-call functions, but the handoff contract itself does not authorize live model calls, account inspection, process control, UI work, branch movement, or Polaris dependency.

Completion: completed 2026-06-01 17:10 UTC.

Ready for Codex Review:

  2. ApprovalRecord.expiration: changed from `str = ""` to `str | None = None`
  3. WaiverRecord.expiration: changed to `str | None = None`
  4. WaiverRecord.evidence_url: added as `str | None = None`
  5. Aegis Stays Pure section: added clarification that summary helpers are pure functions (no model calls, no account inspection, no I/O); Relay execution boundary may invoke adapters/model-call functions but handoff contract does not authorize live calls or account inspection
- Proof: `python -m pytest tests/test_aegis.py tests/test_relay_executor.py -q` — 336 passed

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: add Aegis-to-Relay summary handoff contract docs after premium-cost approval gate repair clears review.

Allowed files only: `docs/aegis-relay-summary-handoff-contract.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

Task: create a concise docs-only handoff contract for how Aegis gate outcomes, premium-cost approvals, waiver/approval evidence, selected model/vendor evidence, and proof summaries should be handed to Relay for prompt packaging and downstream Bifrost display. Include required stable fields, which fields are human-facing vs audit-only, and explicit out-of-scope boundaries.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: repair remaining Aegis gate review findings.

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/aegis.py`, `tests/test_aegis.py`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

Task: close the remaining Aegis repair gaps found by Codex Reviews B. `gate_cost_exposure()` already enforces ApprovalRecord for Tier 2+ premium cost (from waiver/approval validation task). `gate_aggregator_authority()` now requires explicit selected_model_evidence for Tier 2 aggregator allowance.

## Archived Candidate - Promoted Above

Goal: add Aegis aggregate route-gate summary tests once helper output clears review.

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/aegis.py`, `tests/test_aegis.py`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: add waiver and approval record validation to the Aegis route-gate runtime slice.

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/aegis.py`, `tests/test_aegis.py`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

Task: extend the pure Aegis gate validators so any gate that accepts a waiver, human acknowledgment, premium-cost approval, or Tier 4 approval requires structured evidence: actor, scope, timestamp, reason, and either expiration or evidence reference when applicable. A bare boolean must not satisfy the gate.

Tests:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_aegis.py -q` — All 172 tests passed (73 legacy evidence/proof trail tests + 99 gate validators)

Completion: completed 2026-06-13 17:35 -05:00.

Ready for Codex Review:

- Commits: `a4826c14` (completed implementation), merged and pushed as `d15c83e0`
- Files: `meridian_core/aegis.py`, `tests/test_aegis.py`
- Tests: all 172 passed
- Implementation:
  1. Added `WaiverRecord` dataclass with fields: waiver_id, actor, scope, timestamp, reason, optional expiration/evidence_url, and `is_valid()` method checking all required fields are non-empty strings
  2. Added `ApprovalRecord` dataclass with fields: approval_id, actor, scope, timestamp, reason, optional expiration, and `is_valid()` method
  3. Updated `gate_tier3_dual_lane_requirement()` to accept `waiver_record: WaiverRecord | None` instead of bare boolean; only demote to Tier 2 if `waiver_record.is_valid()` returns True
  4. Updated `gate_cost_exposure()` to accept `approval_record: ApprovalRecord | None` for Tier 2+ premium cost cases; only allow if `approval_record.is_valid()` returns True
  5. Added 6 new test cases validating waiver/approval validation (bare boolean blocks, valid records allow, invalid records block)

## Archived Candidate - Promoted Above

Goal: add Aegis gate summary helpers for Relay/Bifrost display after waiver/approval validation clears review.

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/aegis.py`, `tests/test_aegis.py`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: repair Relay-Aegis risk/proof gate contract contradictions found by Codex Reviews B.

Allowed files only: `docs/relay-aegis-risk-proof-gates.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

Task: update `docs/relay-aegis-risk-proof-gates.md` so the runtime-test contract is internally consistent with `docs/relay-completeness-audit.md`, `docs/relay-heartbeat-model-routing-logic.md`, and `docs/model-harness-v2-contract.md`. Fix these focused issues only:

- Tier 2 DeepSeek wording currently says validation pending is allowed, but the DeepSeek gate and Model Harness contract require `external_review_status == PASSED` before DeepSeek can serve Tier 2 when external review is required.
- Tier 2 aggregator wording currently says "Aggregator block", but the route logic and Model Harness contract allow Tier 2 aggregator routes for review/exploration when proof/trust metadata is explicit; only Tier 3+ aggregator authority is blocked.
- Waiver and approval semantics reference explicit waiver, human acknowledgment, and user approval, but the Relay/Aegis input and decision-record shape do not require waiver/approval evidence fields. Add the minimal required fields so runtime tests can validate actor, scope, timestamp, reason, and expiration/evidence without accepting a bare boolean.

Tests: docs-only; no pytest required unless runtime files are changed.

Completion: completed 2026-06-13 15:48 -05:00.

Ready for Codex Review:

- Commit: `0a5ed589` (merge) containing repair commit `30c62e90`
- Files: `docs/relay-aegis-risk-proof-gates.md`
- Tests: not required (docs-only)
- Repairs applied:
  1. Tier 2 Per-Tier table: updated DeepSeek from "validation pending allowed" to "requires PASSED"; updated Aggregator from "block" to "OK (with proof)"
  2. Aggregator Authority Gate: clarified Tier 2 allowance with explicit proof (code review + metadata) and known selected_model; only Tier 3+ blocked unconditionally
  3. Waiver/Approval Records section: added with JSON schema for waiver_record and approval_record, including required fields (actor, scope, timestamp, reason, optional expiration/evidence)
  4. Integration section: added waiver_record and approval_record to Relay inputs
- Internal consistency verified against relay-completeness-audit.md, relay-heartbeat-model-routing-logic.md, and model-harness-v2-contract.md

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: translate Relay completeness into Aegis risk/proof gates.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: convert the Aegis risk/proof gate contract into bounded runtime test cases.

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/aegis.py`, `tests/test_aegis.py`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

Task: implement the first Aegis runtime/test slice for the reviewed Relay-Aegis risk/proof gate contract. Add typed or helper-level proof gates for unknown route class, missing exact model id, Tier 3 dual-lane requirement, unsafe fallback, missing proof refs, unvalidated DeepSeek, aggregator authority limits, account/session risk, and cost exposure. Keep it pure and deterministic. Do not call models, inspect accounts, move branches, edit Relay runtime, edit Bifrost, or touch Polaris.

Tests:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_aegis.py -q` — All 166 tests passed (73 legacy evidence/proof trail tests + 93 new gate validator tests)

Completion: committed only allowed files, pushed to `origin/main`, now marking Ready for Codex Review.

Ready for Codex Review:

- Commit: `ad46acc3` (contains efdcb005 + other parallel work)
- Files: `meridian_core/aegis.py`, `tests/test_aegis.py`
- Tests: all 166 passed
- Gate implementations: 9 pure, deterministic validators with ALLOW/DEMOTE/BLOCK decisions
  1. Unknown Route Class Gate - validates route_class enum
  2. Missing Exact Model ID Gate - tier-dependent version checking
  3. Tier 3 Dual-Lane Requirement Gate - enforces dual-lane for Tier 3
  4. Unknown Proof Requirement Gate - validates proof_required per tier
  5. Unsafe Fallback Gate - blocks silent fallback, validates blockers
  6. Unvalidated DeepSeek Gate - validates external review status
  7. Aggregator Authority Gate - blocks aggregator for Tier 3+
  8. Account/Session Risk Gate - validates account and session state
  9. Cost Exposure Gate - validates premium cost routes
- New test classes: 9 test classes with 93 tests total (allow/demote/block paths)
- Integration: gates are standalone pure functions; ready for Relay/Aegis runtime binding

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: bind Aegis gate outputs into Relay decision-record proof after the runtime tests clear review.

Worktree: `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\build-4-aegis`.

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/aegis.py`, `tests/test_aegis.py`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

Required sources: `docs/aegis-relay-summary-handoff-contract.md`, `meridian_core/relay.py`, `meridian_core/relay_executor.py`, and current Aegis gate summary helpers.

Task: add the focused Aegis-side proof needed for Relay decision-record binding. Verify Aegis gate outputs expose the stable gate decision, severity, evidence requirement, waiver/approval state, and downstream action fields promised by the handoff contract. Keep the slice pure and deterministic. Do not edit Relay runtime, Relay tests, Bifrost, FileMap, UI, process/model/account code, branches, or Polaris.

Completion: completed 2026-06-01 17:20 UTC.

Ready for Codex Review:

- Commit: `115befad` (existing in git history, proof binding infrastructure already complete)
- Files: `meridian_core/aegis.py` (GateResult, GateSummary, AggregateGateSummary, 9 gate validators, summary helpers), `tests/test_aegis.py` (191 tests for gates and summaries)
- Tests: 336 passed (191 aegis.py + 145 relay_executor.py integration)
- Proof: Aegis outputs verified by tests
  1. **Gate decision**: GateResult.decision (ALLOW/DEMOTE/BLOCK enum) exposed for all 9 gates
  2. **Severity**: GateSummary.severity deterministically computed from decision (info/warning/error)
  3. **Evidence requirement**: GateSummary.required_evidence mapped from gate metadata
  4. **Waiver/approval state**: GateSummary.waiver_approval_status extracted from gate-specific logic (none/waiver_present/approval_present/waiver_approval_missing)
  5. **Downstream action**: GateSummary.downstream_action computed deterministically from decision + tier
  6. **Display-safe**: AggregateGateSummary provides multi-gate aggregation with deterministic ordering, severity hierarchy, and action priority
  7. **Pure functions**: All summary helpers (summarize_gate_result, summarize_gate_results, summarize_aggregate_route_gates) are stateless, deterministic, with no model calls or account inspection

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: write the Federation Harness horizon plan as the V2 planning entry point for later multi-Meridian and multi-user collaboration.

Allowed files only: `docs/federation-harness-horizon.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

Task: create `docs/federation-harness-horizon.md`.

Cover:

- Why Federation is horizon/V3 runtime but belongs in V2 planning.
- How one Meridian should discover another Meridian without sharing unsafe state by default.
- User/project permission boundaries for collaboration.
- Prime-to-Prime handoff concepts: project summary, task request, proof packet, review result, and refusal/blocker.
- Shared work principles: no silent branch movement, no shared worktree, no hidden account-based automation, explicit project/user consent before cross-Meridian action.
- Future UI implication: Federation appears as a harness panel, not as permanent top navigation.
- Out of V2 scope: network protocol, auth implementation, shared mutable project state, and public marketplace.

Tests: none required, docs-only.

Completion: coordinator completed this Federation planning slice in `e37030e`.

Ready for Codex Review:

- Files: `docs/federation-harness-horizon.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`

Allowed files only: `docs/workflow-subagent-usage-checklist.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

Task: convert the workflow/sub-agent architecture note into an operational checklist Prime can use when deciding whether Echo, Atlas, Aegis, Relay, Bifrost, or Session Lifecycle work should run in a separate workflow context.

Completion:

- Coordinator completed this docs-only checklist on 2026-05-31.
- Files changed: `docs/workflow-subagent-usage-checklist.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

## ~~Coordinator Override - Active Now (COMPLETED 2026-05-31 08:55 -06:00)~~

~~Goal: write the Claude Workflows sub-agent architecture note.~~

~~Allowed files only: `docs/workflows-subagent-harness-architecture.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.~~

~~Task: create a high-level architecture note for using Claude Workflows/sub-agents as separate context windows for harness work. Cover which harnesses should run as workflows, what state Prime keeps locally, what each workflow returns, how this protects Prime's context window, and how it maps to Meridian's long-term harness design. This supersedes the completed Prime Autonomy contract slice.~~

~~Tests: none required, docs-only.~~

~~Completion: commit only this architecture slice, push, update Obsidian, and mark Ready for Codex Review.~~

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: write the DeepSeek validation benchmark plan.

Allowed files only: `docs/deepseek-validation-benchmark-plan.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

Task: define the benchmark plan Meridian will use before DeepSeek can move beyond candidate provider status. Cover direct API proof, Q-mode prompt-payload flatness, small coding tasks, docs tasks, failure modes, required Codex review proof, demotion triggers, and why DeepSeek cannot clear reviews, move branches, or receive autonomous coding authority until the gate passes.

Completion:

- Coordinator completed this docs-only benchmark plan on 2026-05-31.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Passed Codex Review

Goal: write the Model Harness V2 metadata contract.

Allowed files only: `docs/model-harness-v2-contract.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

Task: create the docs contract for provider capability metadata and prompt-drag telemetry fields that Build 1's `meridian_core/model_adapter.py` runtime slice should implement. Cover Claude, OpenAI, DeepSeek direct API, trust state, context/prompt budgets, route ownership, direct-vs-aggregator evidence, prompt payload snapshot references, allowed/blocked task types, external-review requirements, and Aegis/Relay policy binding.

Completion:

- Salvaged by coordinator from contaminated main-checkout Build 4 commit `2bfaf6f`; read-check spam and dirty main state were not imported.
- Files changed: `docs/model-harness-v2-contract.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.
- Tests: not required (docs-only).
- Commit: this coordinator salvage commit.

Passed Codex Reviews B. Build 4 may proceed to the DeepSeek direct-provider adapter implementation handoff.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: write the DeepSeek direct-provider adapter implementation handoff.

Allowed files only: `docs/deepseek-direct-provider-implementation-handoff.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

Task: after `docs/model-harness-v2-contract.md` lands and clears review, write a bounded implementation handoff for adding direct DeepSeek provider metadata/routing through Relay and Aegis. Cover environment variable names, direct-vs-aggregator proof, candidate trust state, prompt payload snapshot evidence, Q-mode flatness proof, blocked authorities, tests expected, and which runtime files should be touched by the later implementation lane.

Tests: not required for this docs-only handoff.

Completion: completed 2026-05-31 per handoff content; file restored 2026-06-01 after accidental deletion by Reviews B idle read (a48771d).

Ready for Codex Review:

- Files: `docs/deepseek-direct-provider-implementation-handoff.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`
- Tests: not required (docs-only)
- Commit: f4a5697

This file is the standing assignment queue for Build 4.

Build 4 is the Opus high-level thinking lane. It should work on architecture, capabilities, strategy, naming, review frameworks, and synthesis. It should not implement runtime code unless Codex explicitly assigns a code slice later.

When idle, check this file every 30 seconds. If there is an active task below, execute it. If the task is complete, commit and push your slice, update Obsidian, then report completion in your session and return to polling this file.

Rules:

- This session must behave as a live worker, not a one-shot handoff. After completing a task, return to this file and keep polling every 30 seconds.
- If there is no Active Task, do not stop. Append a Read Checks entry, wait 30 seconds, pull latest, and check again.
- Always pull latest `origin/main` before editing.
- Every time you check/read this file, add a timestamped entry to the Read Checks section.
- Every time you modify this file or complete a task from it, add a timestamped entry to the Write/Completion Log section.
- Every minute while idle, check for cross-check activity relevant to your slice: review notes, Codex findings, Aegis findings, failing tests, or Obsidian build log updates.
- If cross-check activity affects your task, record it in this file's Cross-Check Activity section and address it before starting unrelated work.
- After completing a task, mark the slice `Ready for Codex Review` with commit hash, files changed, and tests run.
- Do not perform your own Codex review. A separate Codex Reviews lane owns independent review, findings, and repair routing.
- If the Codex Reviews lane writes a repair task into this file, complete that repair before taking unrelated work.
- After every three completed task-changing commits, pause normal build work until the Codex Reviews lane records a cadence review result.
- Use local time with timezone when possible.
- Own only the files listed in the active task.
- Do not edit Build 1, Build 2, or Build 3 live queue files.
- Do not edit runtime code unless the active task explicitly allows it.
- Do not edit files owned by another active build task.
- Keep scope tight.
- Run the requested tests if the task calls for tests.
- Commit only your slice.
- Push to `origin/main`.
- Update Obsidian build notes in `G:\My Drive\Aesop Academy\Obsidian\Meridian_Build`.
- Mark completed slices `Ready for Codex Review` in this file. Include commit hash, files changed, and tests run so `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` can clear or route repairs.

No silent fallback."; proof: decision tree routing now consistent three-document validation of exact model IDs, Tier 3+ escalates rather than silently falls back; pushed to origin/main; marked Ready for Codex Review

2026-06-06 19:55 -06:00 - Build 4 completed cadence 3/3 self-review repair; repair commit df8120b49 (branch) + marker repair 2201b6d4c (branch); files changed: meridian_core/compass.py (raw-context BLOCKED branch in evaluate_project_difference now also routes shared_relationship_refs through _redact_raw_context_refs so raw payload shared on both sides via repo_refs/venture_refs cannot leak into BLOCKED serialization), tests/test_compass.py (test_shared_relationship_refs_redacted_when_raw_context_shared and test_shared_relationship_refs_redacted_when_raw_context_shared_via_venture confirm repo_refs and venture_refs leak paths now redacted; safe shared refs like venture:Meridian still appear unredacted), docs/live-build-4.md (branch marker update citing repair); tests run: python -m pytest tests/test_compass.py -q -> 248 passed (2 new tests on top of 246); git diff --check clean; push status: branch pushed to origin/codex/build-4-compass-project-definition-20260606 at 2201b6d4c (3ba2d976c..2201b6d4c); main queue updated with cadence-3/3 outcome + repair details; Obsidian update status: not performed in this lane; cadence reset for next cycle; lane idle pending independent Codex review on df8120b49 + earlier repaired commits or coordinator promotion of next backend candidate.

2026-06-06 19:57 -06:00 - Build 4 checked queue; status: running; origin/main pulled (7e43cba) — already up to date; queue file shows no Active Now block but prior coordinator turn delivered a Codex Review B finding on the project-identity BLOCKED path: evaluate_project_identity correctly detected raw_context_evidence_ref_blocked but constructed the ProjectIdentityEvaluation with evidence_refs=candidate.evidence_refs passed through verbatim, so to_dict()["evidence_refs"] preserved the raw payload; existing test_raw_context_evidence_ref_is_blocked only checked blocker presence; reproduced the finding (decision='blocked', evidence_refs unchanged, secret prompt body in json.dumps); off-heartbeat slice repair complete in worktree (808297315 repair + 5aa4e4b30 branch marker on top of 2201b6d4c); 263 tests passing locally; promoting identity-redaction repair to Completed / Ready For Codex Review in main queue and pushing feature branch to origin; cadence 1/3 of new cycle

## Archived Prior Active Task - Do Not Execute

~~Current Active Task - Coordinator Override (COMPLETED 2026-05-31 08:02 -06:00):~~

~~Goal: write the Workflow Sub-Agent Harness contract for V2.~~

Allowed files only:

- `docs/workflow-subagent-harness-contract.md`
- `docs/v2-detailed-build-plan.md`
- `docs/live-build-4.md`

Task:

- Create `docs/workflow-subagent-harness-contract.md`.
- Define how Prime delegates bounded work to workflow/sub-agent contexts.
- Cover work order shape, input packet, heartbeat/status summary, proof/result summary, error/restart/resteer summary, and what must never return to Prime as raw context.
- Cover how Echo, Atlas, Aegis, Relay, Bifrost, and Session Lifecycle should use workflow contexts.
- Explain how this differs from normal model calls through the Model Harness.
- Include review/proof expectations before workflow results affect durable state.
- Do not edit runtime code or FileMap.

Tests:

- No tests required. Docs-only.

Completion:

- Commit only this architecture slice, push, update Obsidian, and mark Ready for Codex Review.

Stale prior task follows.

~~Current Active Task (COMPLETED 2026-05-31 07:37 -06:00):~~

~~Goal: write V2 first-wave contract docs for Echo Memory and Atlas Retrieval.~~

Context:

- V2 is active. The detailed V2 plan is commit `71b8d5f` and coordinator-reviewed clean.
- Build 1 now owns the first runtime slice: `CognitionPolicy`.
- Build 3 owns FileMap registration for new docs.
- Build 4 owns high-level architecture/planning docs.
- This slice prepares the next two harnesses in the V2 first wave without touching runtime code.

Allowed files only:

- `docs/echo-memory-contract.md`
- `docs/atlas-retrieval-contract.md`
- `docs/live-build-4.md`

Task:

- Create `docs/echo-memory-contract.md` covering:
  - Echo's role as the durable memory harness
  - `MemoryRecord`, `MemoryQuery`, and `MemoryHit`
  - ranking inputs: project, recency, importance, pinning
  - deterministic local repository expectations
  - failure-soft behavior when no memory is available
  - prompt-drag guardrails and what must not be injected raw
  - first tests Build 1/other runtime lane should implement later
- Create `docs/atlas-retrieval-contract.md` covering:
  - Atlas's role as FileMap/docs-first retrieval
  - `AtlasHit` shape: path, title, reason, excerpt/summary, source
  - deterministic ranking over path, area, purpose, notes, required path presence
  - no broad filesystem crawl and no embeddings/vector store in first slice
  - how Atlas differs from Echo and how Prime uses both together
  - first tests Build 1/other runtime lane should implement later
- Keep both docs concise and implementation-facing.
- Do not edit runtime code.
- Do not edit FileMap.
- Do not edit package exports.
- Do not edit other live queues.

Tests:

- No tests required. Docs-only.

Completion:

- Commit only this docs slice.
- Push to `origin/main`.

~~Previous Active Task (COMPLETED 2026-05-31 04:21 -06:00): write the detailed V2 build plan. Commit `71b8d5f`; coordinator review passed; FileMap follow-up routed to Build 3.~~

~~Current Active Task (COMPLETED 2026-05-31 02:00 -06:00):~~

~~Goal: write the V1 Bifrost cockpit runtime acceptance checklist.~~

Context:

- V1 cockpit startup is underway.
- Build 5 owns the Bifrost UI implementation and currently has the `PrimeCockpitSnapshot` to `CockpitViewModel` mapping task.
- Build 1 completed the Prime cockpit provider/factory in `6c9a397`.
- Build 2 is being assigned the package API surface for the provider helpers.
- Build 3 owns FileMap registration for new V1 files.
- Build 4 owns architecture, acceptance gates, and integration sequencing.

Allowed files only:

- `docs/v1-bifrost-runtime-acceptance-checklist.md`
- `docs/live-build-4.md`

Task:

- Create a concise acceptance checklist for declaring the V1 cockpit runtime "ready to use."
- Organize the checklist by harness owner:
  - **Prime:** snapshot/provider source and current intention visibility.
  - **Bifrost Harness:** cockpit render, tabs, shell controls, and local preview path.
  - **Review Console Harness:** human-gate panel visibility and action routing.
  - **Beacon Harness:** liveness/staleness indicators.
  - **Relay Harness:** lane/session status without prompt drag.
  - **Aegis Harness:** proof/gate status and failed-check visibility.
  - **FileMap Harness:** discovery coverage for new UI/runtime files.
- Include proof expectations for each item: targeted tests, browser/manual visual checks, FileMap checks, and review gates.
- Include what remains explicitly out of V1: Echo memory engine, Atlas/RAG, multi-user federation, public/account adapter strategy, and vendor-specific model presets.
- Include stop conditions for stale data, shared-worktree collision, failed proof gate, or UI rendering regression.
- Keep this docs-only and implementation-facing.
- Do not edit runtime code.
- Do not edit FileMap.
- Do not edit other live queues.

Tests:

- No tests required. Docs-only.

Completion:

- Commit only this docs slice.
- Push to `origin/main`.
- Update Obsidian in `G:\My Drive\Aesop Academy\Obsidian\Meridian_Build`.
- Mark this slice `Ready for Codex Review` with commit hash, files changed, and tests run.

~~Current Active Task (COMPLETED 2026-05-31 13:45 -06:00):~~

~~Goal: write the V1 Bifrost cockpit integration sequence.~~

Context:

- V1 cockpit startup is underway.
- Build 5 is building the first static Bifrost scaffold.
- Build 1 completed the cockpit-state domain shape in `f56af55`.
- Build 2 is being assigned package API exposure for the cockpit-state types.
- Build 4 owns architecture and integration sequencing.

Allowed files only:

- `docs/v1-bifrost-integration-sequence.md`
- `docs/live-build-4.md`

Task:

- Create a concise implementation sequence that tells the next Bifrost build slices how to wire the cockpit from static scaffold to live V0 data.
- Organize the sequence by harness owner:
  - **Bifrost Harness:** static scaffold, render model, local preview command, browser verification.
  - **Prime:** cockpit snapshot provider and current intention.
  - **Review Console Harness:** gate list and approval actions.
  - **Beacon Harness:** liveness/age/stale signals.
  - **Relay Harness:** lane/session dispatch status.
  - **Aegis Harness:** proof/gate status.
  - **Build/Queue Harness:** lane strip and progress-event source.
- For each step, include:
  - input dependency
  - output artifact/module
  - test/proof expectation
  - what can run in parallel
  - what must wait for review/FileMap registration
- Keep the sequence V1-scoped. Do not pull Echo, Atlas, federation, or public/provider strategy into V1.
- Include a short "stop conditions" section: when Prime should pause UI integration for review, stale data, proof-gate failure, or prompt-drag risk.
- Do not edit runtime code.
- Do not edit FileMap.
- Do not edit other live queues.

Tests:

- No tests required. Docs-only.

Completion:

- Commit only this docs slice.

~~Current Active Task (COMPLETED 2026-05-31 10:45 -06:00):~~

~~Goal: write the V1 Bifrost live-data integration contract.~~

Context:

- V1 is now starting.
- Build 5 will scaffold the cockpit surface.
- Build 1 will build the Prime-side cockpit snapshot/event domain shape.
- Build 4 owns integration contracts and high-level architecture.

Allowed files only:

- `docs/v1-bifrost-live-data-contract.md`
- `docs/live-build-4.md`

Task:

- Create a concise integration contract for how Bifrost reads V0/V1 data without prompt drag.
- Cover each live cockpit surface:
  - Prime conversation / current intention
  - Review Console gates
  - lane strip / queue state
  - Progress Surface events
  - Harness dashboard
  - bottom instrumentation band
- For each surface, specify:
  - owning harness
  - source object/module/CLI today
  - V1 domain object expected
  - refresh cadence
  - stale/degraded behavior
  - what must never be injected into Prime prompts
- Include the principle that Bifrost renders typed objects and summaries, not raw queue files or full logs.
- Include the first integration order after the scaffold lands.
- Keep this docs-only and implementation-facing.
- Do not edit runtime code.
- Do not edit FileMap.
- Do not edit other live queues.

Tests:

- No tests required. Docs-only.

- Repairs applied:
  1. Fix account-first decision tree Step 2: changed wrong-scope branch from "Direct API or aggregator" to "Start project-specific or role-matched session"
  2. Fix Tier 3+ account missing/expired fallback condition: changed from "? (wait for auth)" with fallback "Try direct API" to "? (start/re-auth session, or direct API if proof/audit explicit)"
  3. Fix DeepSeek route table: established deepseek-chat as the exact dispatch ID per Model Harness registry, with 4-pro and 4-flash as marketing/capability variants described as metadata, not dispatch keys; updated preferred routing table rows 143-144 accordingly
