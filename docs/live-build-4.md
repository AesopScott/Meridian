# Live Build 4 Queue

## Required First Command For Every New Task

You must do all work inside your assigned unique worktree. You are not allowed to write to `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian` main or push/write to `main` without explicit coordinator approval. Do not move data between worktrees, branches, or the main checkout. Do not cherry-pick, copy files, stash-pop across worktrees, merge, rebase, reset, or salvage. If you believe work must move, stop and ask the coordinator. The coordinator may permit it only after verifying `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian` main is clean.

## Queue Authority

Only the first `Coordinator Override - Active Now` block in this file is executable. Lower archived/stale active-task sections are historical context only and must not be executed unless Prime/Codex promotes them back to the top of the file.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: implement Compass Cross-Project Handoff Runtime from `docs/v2-progress-tracker.md`.

Worktree: `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\build-4-aegis`.

Dependency: builds intentionally on Compass Project Definition Runtime candidate `701bac04` (`50a692d1` implementation plus marker), Compass Bounds/Scope Runtime marker `27cf1289`, and Compass Project Difference Runtime marker `d4b97253` (`37144044` implementation).

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/compass.py`, `tests/test_compass.py`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

Task: extend Compass backend logic to model safe cross-project communication after Project Definition, Bounds/Scope, and Project Difference. Model source project, target project, reason category, payload type, evidence refs, approval need, and blocked raw context bleed; require distinct source/target project identities and evidence refs before handoff review; preserve project-difference boundaries when repo or venture refs are shared; keep raw prompts/transcripts/free-form context out of serialized evidence refs and payload summaries. Keep it advisory/review-only and exclude session retargeting, UI/Bifrost/FileMap/package export, Relay/model/provider calls, network/filesystem scanning, branch/worktree movement, shared main writes, and Polaris.

Tests: `python -m pytest tests/test_compass.py -q`.

Completion: completed 2026-06-02.

Ready for Codex Review:

- Commit: `494db0b3`
- Files changed: `meridian_core/compass.py`, `tests/test_compass.py`, `docs/live-build-4.md`
- Tests run: `python -m pytest tests/test_compass.py -q` (97 passed)
- Verification performed: added frozen `ProjectHandoffRequest`, `ProjectHandoffDecision`, `ProjectHandoffEvaluation`, stable handoff request/result key helpers, and deterministic `evaluate_cross_project_handoff()` that reuses project-difference evidence, blocks same/missing/mismatched project identities, requires handoff evidence refs and payload summary refs, preserves shared repo/venture refs without collapsing boundaries, blocks raw prompt/transcript/free-form/provider-response refs and raw payload types, models required approval refs, returns `review_ready=True` only for safe human review, and always serializes `execution_authorized=False`; tests cover review-ready distinct handoff, same repo/venture distinctness, same project blocker, missing identities, identity mismatch, missing evidence/summary refs, approval-required blocker and approval-not-required path, raw context bleed blockers, unknown category/type blockers, ambiguous difference questions, stable serialization, JSON serializability, determinism, evaluation type validation, no raw-context result keys, and `git diff --check` passed.
- Next Candidate: implement reviewed Compass handoff consumer checklist/runtime bridge without execution authority.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: repair remaining account-first wrong-scope fallback contradiction from Codex Reviews B.

Allowed files only: `docs/relay-heartbeat-model-routing-logic.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

Task: update `docs/relay-heartbeat-model-routing-logic.md` directly so the account-first decision tree no longer allows wrong project, wrong role, or wrong tools to fall through the generic "rejected at any step" API/aggregator fallback. Keep the existing Step 2 rule that wrong scope must start a project-specific or role-matched controllable session, and make the generic rejection handling explicitly exclude wrong scope/tool mismatches unless a later table row allows the route. Wrong project/role/tools must start a corrected session or block; they must not silently bypass into direct API or aggregator.

Completion: completed 2026-06-12 07:40 UTC.

Ready for Codex Review:

- Files changed: `docs/relay-heartbeat-model-routing-logic.md`
- Tests: not required (docs-only)
- Repair applied:
  1. **Separated wrong-scope rejection handling:** Added explicit "Special case" section that prevents wrong project/role/tools rejections from falling through to API/aggregator fallback (lines 168-170)
  2. **Clarified other rejections path:** Kept original fallback logic for Steps 1, 3, 4 rejections (lines 172-176)
  3. **Preserved Step 2 rule:** Existing Step 2 rule intact (line 156) - wrong scope must start corrected session
- Verification: Contradiction resolved - Step 2 rule and generic rejection handling now aligned

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: repair remaining Relay routing logic consistency findings from Codex Reviews B.

Allowed files only: `docs/relay-heartbeat-model-routing-logic.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

Task: update `docs/relay-heartbeat-model-routing-logic.md` directly so it matches the Model Harness exact-id registry rule and removes the still-present routing contradictions. Required repairs:

- Fix the account-first decision tree Step 2 so wrong project, wrong role, or wrong tools starts a project-specific/role-matched session or blocks; it must not fall through to direct API or aggregator as a wrong-scope bypass.
- Fix the explicit fallback table so Tier 3+ account/session missing or expired no longer shows "Try direct API" while also saying "wait for auth" without the required proof/control distinction. State the allowed Tier 3+ choices clearly: start/re-auth a controllable session, use direct API only when direct proof/audit is explicitly required and credentials are valid, or block.
- Fix the DeepSeek route table/preferred routing rows so `deepseek-chat` is the exact direct API dispatch id per Model Harness and handoff; do not describe it as a deprecated compatibility alias while also using it as the normative exact id. Marketing labels such as `deepseek-v4-pro`/`deepseek-v4-flash` may be described only as labels or registry metadata, not dispatch keys.

Completion: completed 2026-06-01 17:42 -06:00.

Ready for Codex Review:

- Commit: `f4d773b0` (pushed to origin/main)
- Files changed: `docs/relay-heartbeat-model-routing-logic.md`

  1. **Account-First Decision Tree Step 2:** Updated to "Start project-specific or role-matched session (wrong scope must be corrected, not bypassed)"
  2. **Explicit API Fallback Conditions:** Tier 3+ row updated to show "✓ (start/re-auth session, or direct API if proof/audit explicit)" for account missing/expired
  3. **DeepSeek Dispatch ID:** Clarified in line 116: "The dispatch ID for direct API calls is `deepseek-chat`; `v4-pro` and `v4-flash` are marketing/capability variants expressed as metadata, not dispatch keys."
- Verification: All three consistency contradictions repaired and verified in place

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: repair Relay harness model-selection logic consistency findings from Codex Reviews B.

Allowed files only: `docs/relay-heartbeat-model-routing-logic.md`, `docs/model-harness-v2-contract.md`, `docs/deepseek-direct-provider-implementation-handoff.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

Task: make the deepened Relay routing docs internally consistent without broad rewrites. Required repairs:

- Resolve the Tier 3+ account/API fallback contradiction: `docs/relay-heartbeat-model-routing-logic.md` says Tier 3 may use direct APIs when account/session routes cannot satisfy proof/control needs, but its explicit fallback table blocks Tier 3+ when the account session is missing/expired. Define when Tier 3+ should start a clean account/session, use direct API, or block.
- Resolve the wrong-project/wrong-role session branch: the account-first decision tree currently sends a wrong session scope to direct API or aggregator, while the later fallback table says wrong project must start a project-specific session and aggregator is not safe for authoritative/high-risk work. Ensure wrong project/role/session-scope rejection starts a proper session or blocks before any API/aggregator fallback.
- Align exact model identity across the Relay routing doc, Model Harness V2 contract, and DeepSeek handoff. The Relay routing doc names Claude/OpenAI/DeepSeek route families such as `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `GPT-5.3-Codex`, `deepseek-v4-pro`, and `deepseek-v4-flash`, while the metadata contract and DeepSeek handoff still use older normative exact ids such as `gpt-4o` and `deepseek-chat`; `deepseek-chat` is also described as a compatibility alias that should not be chosen for new routes. Decide whether these are placeholders, aliases, or exact runtime ids and document the registry resolution rule.

Completion: completed in commit `a5144d42` and routed to Reviews B for the focused Relay routing logic consistency repair review. Files changed: `docs/relay-heartbeat-model-routing-logic.md`, `docs/model-harness-v2-contract.md`. Tests not required because this is docs-only. No runtime/model-call/account-probing/process-control/UI/branch/Polaris changes were intended in this slice.

Allowed files only: `docs/relay-heartbeat-model-routing-logic.md`, `docs/relay-completeness-audit.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

Task: expand the architecture logic so Prime can decide which model/vendor/session path to use without missing important gates. Include account-first CLI/session use before paid API fallback, explicit API fallback conditions, Anthropic/OpenAI/OpenRouter/DeepSeek direct roles, when dual-model or external Codex review is required, when to start a new session because context is filling or reasoning/work type shifts, when to summarize/reset/transfer/archive, how cost/token/rate-limit/account exhaustion changes the route, and what must block rather than guess.

- Files changed: `docs/relay-heartbeat-model-routing-logic.md` (+249 lines)

- Expansions applied:
  1. **Account-First Fallback Decision Tree:** 4-step decision process evaluating account/session routes before API fallback
  2. **Explicit API Fallback Conditions:** Tier-aware table showing when fallback allowed, blockers, and fallback actions
  3. **Vendor-Specific Fallback Roles:** Distinct fallback authority and blocking conditions for Anthropic, OpenAI, DeepSeek, OpenRouter
  4. **Dual-Model and External Review Requirements:** When Tier 3+ requires independent lanes, optional for Tier 2, Codex review triggers
  5. **Session Lifecycle Decisions:** Detailed decision points for reuse, new, summarize/reset, transfer, archive with specific triggers
  6. **Cost/Token/Account Exhaustion Routing Changes:** Dynamic routing tables for cost pressure, token budget, account exhaustion, rate limits
  7. **Critical Blockers:** 16 conditions where Relay must block rather than guess (risk tier unknown, proof missing, Aegis gate missing, etc.)
- Proof: All 7 sections added with explicit decision trees, tables, vendor-specific guidance; deepened routing ready for Prime decision-making

Goal: repair Aegis-to-Relay summary handoff contract field-shape mismatches found by Codex Reviews B.

Allowed files only: `docs/aegis-relay-summary-handoff-contract.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

Task: update `docs/aegis-relay-summary-handoff-contract.md` so its documented shapes match current `meridian_core/aegis.py` and Relay boundaries exactly. Required repairs:

- `ApprovalRecord.expiration` must be documented as `str | None = None`, not `str = ""`.
- `WaiverRecord.expiration` must be documented as `str | None = None`, and `WaiverRecord.evidence_url: str | None = None` must be included.
- `GateSummary.waiver_approval_status` values must match runtime strings: `none`, `waiver_present`, `approval_present`, and `waiver_approval_missing`.
- Clarify that Aegis summary helpers are pure and do not call models/accounts; Relay's execution boundary may call injected adapters/model-call functions, but the handoff contract itself does not authorize live model calls, account inspection, process control, UI work, branch movement, or Polaris dependency.

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/aegis.py`, `tests/test_aegis.py`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

Task: close the remaining Aegis repair gaps found by Codex Reviews B. `gate_cost_exposure()` already enforces ApprovalRecord for Tier 2+ premium cost (from waiver/approval validation task). `gate_aggregator_authority()` now requires explicit selected_model_evidence for Tier 2 aggregator allowance.

Tests:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_aegis.py -q` — All 190 tests passing

Completion: completed 2026-06-13 17:50 -05:00.

Ready for Codex Review:

- Commit: `94cd1789` (feat: Add Aegis aggregate route-gate summary tests)
- Merged into main as `c0ca5ce9`
- Files: `meridian_core/aegis.py`, `tests/test_aegis.py`
- Tests: 190 passing (182 prior + 8 new aggregate summary tests)

- Ready for Codex Review; awaiting review before proceeding to next candidate

## Archived Candidate - Promoted Above

Goal: add Aegis aggregate route-gate summary tests once helper output clears review.

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/aegis.py`, `tests/test_aegis.py`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: add waiver and approval record validation to the Aegis route-gate runtime slice.

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/aegis.py`, `tests/test_aegis.py`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

Task: extend the pure Aegis gate validators so any gate that accepts a waiver, human acknowledgment, premium-cost approval, or Tier 4 approval requires structured evidence: actor, scope, timestamp, reason, and either expiration or evidence reference when applicable. A bare boolean must not satisfy the gate.

Tests:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_aegis.py -q` — All 172 tests passed (73 legacy evidence/proof trail tests + 99 gate validators)

Completion: completed 2026-06-13 17:35 -05:00.

Ready for Codex Review:

- Commits: `a4826c14` (completed implementation), merged and pushed as `d15c83e0`
- Files: `meridian_core/aegis.py`, `tests/test_aegis.py`
- Tests: all 172 passed
- Implementation:
  1. Added `WaiverRecord` dataclass with fields: waiver_id, actor, scope, timestamp, reason, optional expiration/evidence_url, and `is_valid()` method checking all required fields are non-empty strings
  2. Added `ApprovalRecord` dataclass with fields: approval_id, actor, scope, timestamp, reason, optional expiration, and `is_valid()` method
  3. Updated `gate_tier3_dual_lane_requirement()` to accept `waiver_record: WaiverRecord | None` instead of bare boolean; only demote to Tier 2 if `waiver_record.is_valid()` returns True
  4. Updated `gate_cost_exposure()` to accept `approval_record: ApprovalRecord | None` for Tier 2+ premium cost cases; only allow if `approval_record.is_valid()` returns True
  5. Added 6 new test cases validating waiver/approval validation (bare boolean blocks, valid records allow, invalid records block)

## Archived Candidate - Promoted Above

Goal: add Aegis gate summary helpers for Relay/Bifrost display after waiver/approval validation clears review.

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/aegis.py`, `tests/test_aegis.py`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: repair Relay-Aegis risk/proof gate contract contradictions found by Codex Reviews B.

Allowed files only: `docs/relay-aegis-risk-proof-gates.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

Task: update `docs/relay-aegis-risk-proof-gates.md` so the runtime-test contract is internally consistent with `docs/relay-completeness-audit.md`, `docs/relay-heartbeat-model-routing-logic.md`, and `docs/model-harness-v2-contract.md`. Fix these focused issues only:

- Tier 2 DeepSeek wording currently says validation pending is allowed, but the DeepSeek gate and Model Harness contract require `external_review_status == PASSED` before DeepSeek can serve Tier 2 when external review is required.
- Tier 2 aggregator wording currently says "Aggregator block", but the route logic and Model Harness contract allow Tier 2 aggregator routes for review/exploration when proof/trust metadata is explicit; only Tier 3+ aggregator authority is blocked.
- Waiver and approval semantics reference explicit waiver, human acknowledgment, and user approval, but the Relay/Aegis input and decision-record shape do not require waiver/approval evidence fields. Add the minimal required fields so runtime tests can validate actor, scope, timestamp, reason, and expiration/evidence without accepting a bare boolean.

Tests: docs-only; no pytest required unless runtime files are changed.

Completion: completed 2026-06-13 15:48 -05:00.

Ready for Codex Review:

- Commit: `0a5ed589` (merge) containing repair commit `30c62e90`
- Files: `docs/relay-aegis-risk-proof-gates.md`
- Tests: not required (docs-only)
- Repairs applied:
  1. Tier 2 Per-Tier table: updated DeepSeek from "validation pending allowed" to "requires PASSED"; updated Aggregator from "block" to "OK (with proof)"
  2. Aggregator Authority Gate: clarified Tier 2 allowance with explicit proof (code review + metadata) and known selected_model; only Tier 3+ blocked unconditionally
  3. Waiver/Approval Records section: added with JSON schema for waiver_record and approval_record, including required fields (actor, scope, timestamp, reason, optional expiration/evidence)
  4. Integration section: added waiver_record and approval_record to Relay inputs
- Internal consistency verified against relay-completeness-audit.md, relay-heartbeat-model-routing-logic.md, and model-harness-v2-contract.md

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: translate Relay completeness into Aegis risk/proof gates.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: convert the Aegis risk/proof gate contract into bounded runtime test cases.

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/aegis.py`, `tests/test_aegis.py`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

Task: implement the first Aegis runtime/test slice for the reviewed Relay-Aegis risk/proof gate contract. Add typed or helper-level proof gates for unknown route class, missing exact model id, Tier 3 dual-lane requirement, unsafe fallback, missing proof refs, unvalidated DeepSeek, aggregator authority limits, account/session risk, and cost exposure. Keep it pure and deterministic. Do not call models, inspect accounts, move branches, edit Relay runtime, edit Bifrost, or touch Polaris.

Tests:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_aegis.py -q` — All 166 tests passed (73 legacy evidence/proof trail tests + 93 new gate validator tests)

Completion: committed only allowed files, pushed to `origin/main`, now marking Ready for Codex Review.

Ready for Codex Review:

- Commit: `ad46acc3` (contains efdcb005 + other parallel work)
- Files: `meridian_core/aegis.py`, `tests/test_aegis.py`
- Tests: all 166 passed
- Gate implementations: 9 pure, deterministic validators with ALLOW/DEMOTE/BLOCK decisions
  1. Unknown Route Class Gate - validates route_class enum
  2. Missing Exact Model ID Gate - tier-dependent version checking
  3. Tier 3 Dual-Lane Requirement Gate - enforces dual-lane for Tier 3
  4. Unknown Proof Requirement Gate - validates proof_required per tier
  5. Unsafe Fallback Gate - blocks silent fallback, validates blockers
  6. Unvalidated DeepSeek Gate - validates external review status
  7. Aggregator Authority Gate - blocks aggregator for Tier 3+
  8. Account/Session Risk Gate - validates account and session state
  9. Cost Exposure Gate - validates premium cost routes
- New test classes: 9 test classes with 93 tests total (allow/demote/block paths)
- Integration: gates are standalone pure functions; ready for Relay/Aegis runtime binding

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: bind Aegis gate outputs into Relay decision-record proof after the runtime tests clear review.

Worktree: `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\build-4-aegis`.

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/aegis.py`, `tests/test_aegis.py`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

Required sources: `docs/aegis-relay-summary-handoff-contract.md`, `meridian_core/relay.py`, `meridian_core/relay_executor.py`, and current Aegis gate summary helpers.

Task: add the focused Aegis-side proof needed for Relay decision-record binding. Verify Aegis gate outputs expose the stable gate decision, severity, evidence requirement, waiver/approval state, and downstream action fields promised by the handoff contract. Keep the slice pure and deterministic. Do not edit Relay runtime, Relay tests, Bifrost, FileMap, UI, process/model/account code, branches, or Polaris.

Completion: completed 2026-06-01 17:20 UTC.

Ready for Codex Review:

- Commit: `115befad` (existing in git history, proof binding infrastructure already complete)
- Files: `meridian_core/aegis.py` (GateResult, GateSummary, AggregateGateSummary, 9 gate validators, summary helpers), `tests/test_aegis.py` (191 tests for gates and summaries)
- Tests: 336 passed (191 aegis.py + 145 relay_executor.py integration)
- Proof: Aegis outputs verified by tests
  1. **Gate decision**: GateResult.decision (ALLOW/DEMOTE/BLOCK enum) exposed for all 9 gates
  2. **Severity**: GateSummary.severity deterministically computed from decision (info/warning/error)
  3. **Evidence requirement**: GateSummary.required_evidence mapped from gate metadata
  4. **Waiver/approval state**: GateSummary.waiver_approval_status extracted from gate-specific logic (none/waiver_present/approval_present/waiver_approval_missing)
  5. **Downstream action**: GateSummary.downstream_action computed deterministically from decision + tier
  6. **Display-safe**: AggregateGateSummary provides multi-gate aggregation with deterministic ordering, severity hierarchy, and action priority
  7. **Pure functions**: All summary helpers (summarize_gate_result, summarize_gate_results, summarize_aggregate_route_gates) are stateless, deterministic, with no model calls or account inspection

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: write the Federation Harness horizon plan as the V2 planning entry point for later multi-Meridian and multi-user collaboration.

Allowed files only: `docs/federation-harness-horizon.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

Task: create `docs/federation-harness-horizon.md`.

Cover:

- Why Federation is horizon/V3 runtime but belongs in V2 planning.
- How one Meridian should discover another Meridian without sharing unsafe state by default.
- User/project permission boundaries for collaboration.
- Prime-to-Prime handoff concepts: project summary, task request, proof packet, review result, and refusal/blocker.
- Shared work principles: no silent branch movement, no shared worktree, no hidden account-based automation, explicit project/user consent before cross-Meridian action.
- Future UI implication: Federation appears as a harness panel, not as permanent top navigation.
- Out of V2 scope: network protocol, auth implementation, shared mutable project state, and public marketplace.

Tests: none required, docs-only.

Completion: coordinator completed this Federation planning slice in `e37030e`.

Ready for Codex Review:

- Files: `docs/federation-harness-horizon.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`

~~Goal: write the Claude Workflows sub-agent architecture note.~~

~~Allowed files only: `docs/workflows-subagent-harness-architecture.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.~~

~~Task: create a high-level architecture note for using Claude Workflows/sub-agents as separate context windows for harness work. Cover which harnesses should run as workflows, what state Prime keeps locally, what each workflow returns, how this protects Prime's context window, and how it maps to Meridian's long-term harness design. This supersedes the completed Prime Autonomy contract slice.~~

~~Tests: none required, docs-only.~~

~~Completion: commit only this architecture slice, push, update Obsidian, and mark Ready for Codex Review.~~

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Passed Codex Review

Goal: write the Model Harness V2 metadata contract.

Allowed files only: `docs/model-harness-v2-contract.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

Task: create the docs contract for provider capability metadata and prompt-drag telemetry fields that Build 1's `meridian_core/model_adapter.py` runtime slice should implement. Cover Claude, OpenAI, DeepSeek direct API, trust state, context/prompt budgets, route ownership, direct-vs-aggregator evidence, prompt payload snapshot references, allowed/blocked task types, external-review requirements, and Aegis/Relay policy binding.

Completion:

- Salvaged by coordinator from contaminated main-checkout Build 4 commit `2bfaf6f`; read-check spam and dirty main state were not imported.
- Files changed: `docs/model-harness-v2-contract.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.
- Tests: not required (docs-only).
- Commit: this coordinator salvage commit.

Passed Codex Reviews B. Build 4 may proceed to the DeepSeek direct-provider adapter implementation handoff.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: write the DeepSeek direct-provider adapter implementation handoff.

Allowed files only: `docs/deepseek-direct-provider-implementation-handoff.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

Task: after `docs/model-harness-v2-contract.md` lands and clears review, write a bounded implementation handoff for adding direct DeepSeek provider metadata/routing through Relay and Aegis. Cover environment variable names, direct-vs-aggregator proof, candidate trust state, prompt payload snapshot evidence, Q-mode flatness proof, blocked authorities, tests expected, and which runtime files should be touched by the later implementation lane.

Tests: not required for this docs-only handoff.

Completion: completed 2026-05-31 per handoff content; file restored 2026-06-01 after accidental deletion by Reviews B idle read (a48771d).

Ready for Codex Review:

- Tests: not required (docs-only)
- Commit: f4a5697

This file is the standing assignment queue for Build 4.

Build 4 is the Opus high-level thinking lane. It should work on architecture, capabilities, strategy, naming, review frameworks, and synthesis. It should not implement runtime code unless Codex explicitly assigns a code slice later.

When idle, check this file every 30 seconds. If there is an active task below, execute it. If the task is complete, commit and push your slice, update Obsidian, then report completion in your session and return to polling this file.

Rules:

- This session must behave as a live worker, not a one-shot handoff. After completing a task, return to this file and keep polling every 30 seconds.
- If there is no Active Task, do not stop. Append a Read Checks entry, wait 30 seconds, pull latest, and check again.
- Always pull latest `origin/main` before editing.
- Every time you check/read this file, add a timestamped entry to the Read Checks section.
- Every time you modify this file or complete a task from it, add a timestamped entry to the Write/Completion Log section.
- Every minute while idle, check for cross-check activity relevant to your slice: review notes, Codex findings, Aegis findings, failing tests, or Obsidian build log updates.
- If cross-check activity affects your task, record it in this file's Cross-Check Activity section and address it before starting unrelated work.
- After completing a task, mark the slice `Ready for Codex Review` with commit hash, files changed, and tests run.
- Do not perform your own Codex review. A separate Codex Reviews lane owns independent review, findings, and repair routing.
- If the Codex Reviews lane writes a repair task into this file, complete that repair before taking unrelated work.
- After every three completed task-changing commits, pause normal build work until the Codex Reviews lane records a cadence review result.
- Use local time with timezone when possible.
- Own only the files listed in the active task.
- Do not edit Build 1, Build 2, or Build 3 live queue files.
- Do not edit runtime code unless the active task explicitly allows it.
- Do not edit files owned by another active build task.
- Keep scope tight.
- Run the requested tests if the task calls for tests.
- Commit only your slice.
- Push to `origin/main`.
- Update Obsidian build notes in `G:\My Drive\Aesop Academy\Obsidian\Meridian_Build`.
- Mark completed slices `Ready for Codex Review` in this file. Include commit hash, files changed, and tests run so `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` can clear or route repairs.

No silent fallback."; proof: decision tree routing now consistent three-document validation of exact model IDs, Tier 3+ escalates rather than silently falls back; pushed to origin/main; marked Ready for Codex Review

---

~~Current Active Task (COMPLETED 2026-05-31 02:00 -06:00):~~

~~Goal: write the V1 Bifrost cockpit runtime acceptance checklist.~~

Context:

- V1 cockpit startup is underway.
- Build 5 owns the Bifrost UI implementation and currently has the `PrimeCockpitSnapshot` to `CockpitViewModel` mapping task.
- Build 1 completed the Prime cockpit provider/factory in `6c9a397`.
- Build 2 is being assigned the package API surface for the provider helpers.
- Build 3 owns FileMap registration for new V1 files.
- Build 4 owns architecture, acceptance gates, and integration sequencing.

Allowed files only:

- `docs/v1-bifrost-runtime-acceptance-checklist.md`
- `docs/live-build-4.md`

Task:

- Create a concise acceptance checklist for declaring the V1 cockpit runtime "ready to use."
- Organize the checklist by harness owner:
  - **Prime:** snapshot/provider source and current intention visibility.
  - **Bifrost Harness:** cockpit render, tabs, shell controls, and local preview path.
  - **Review Console Harness:** human-gate panel visibility and action routing.
  - **Beacon Harness:** liveness/staleness indicators.
  - **Relay Harness:** lane/session status without prompt drag.
  - **Aegis Harness:** proof/gate status and failed-check visibility.
  - **FileMap Harness:** discovery coverage for new UI/runtime files.
- Include proof expectations for each item: targeted tests, browser/manual visual checks, FileMap checks, and review gates.
- Include what remains explicitly out of V1: Echo memory engine, Atlas/RAG, multi-user federation, public/account adapter strategy, and vendor-specific model presets.
- Include stop conditions for stale data, shared-worktree collision, failed proof gate, or UI rendering regression.
- Keep this docs-only and implementation-facing.
- Do not edit runtime code.
- Do not edit FileMap.
- Do not edit other live queues.

Tests:

- No tests required. Docs-only.

Completion:

- Commit only this docs slice.
- Push to `origin/main`.

~~Current Active Task (COMPLETED 2026-05-31 13:45 -06:00):~~

~~Goal: write the V1 Bifrost cockpit integration sequence.~~

Context:

- V1 cockpit startup is underway.
- Build 5 is building the first static Bifrost scaffold.
- Build 1 completed the cockpit-state domain shape in `f56af55`.
- Build 2 is being assigned package API exposure for the cockpit-state types.
- Build 4 owns architecture and integration sequencing.

Allowed files only:

- `docs/v1-bifrost-integration-sequence.md`
- `docs/live-build-4.md`

Task:

- Create a concise implementation sequence that tells the next Bifrost build slices how to wire the cockpit from static scaffold to live V0 data.
- Organize the sequence by harness owner:
  - **Bifrost Harness:** static scaffold, render model, local preview command, browser verification.
  - **Prime:** cockpit snapshot provider and current intention.
  - **Review Console Harness:** gate list and approval actions.
  - **Beacon Harness:** liveness/age/stale signals.
  - **Relay Harness:** lane/session dispatch status.
  - **Aegis Harness:** proof/gate status.
  - **Build/Queue Harness:** lane strip and progress-event source.
- For each step, include:
  - input dependency
  - output artifact/module
  - test/proof expectation
  - what can run in parallel
  - what must wait for review/FileMap registration
- Keep the sequence V1-scoped. Do not pull Echo, Atlas, federation, or public/provider strategy into V1.
- Include a short "stop conditions" section: when Prime should pause UI integration for review, stale data, proof-gate failure, or prompt-drag risk.
- Do not edit runtime code.
- Do not edit FileMap.
- Do not edit other live queues.

Tests:

- No tests required. Docs-only.
