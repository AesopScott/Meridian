# Live Build 4 Queue

## Required First Command For Every New Task

You must do all work inside your assigned unique worktree. You are not allowed to write to `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian` main or push/write to `main` without explicit coordinator approval. Do not move data between worktrees, branches, or the main checkout. Do not cherry-pick, copy files, stash-pop across worktrees, merge, rebase, reset, or salvage. If you believe work must move, stop and ask the coordinator. The coordinator may permit it only after verifying `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian` main is clean.

## Queue Authority

Only the first `Coordinator Override - Active Now` block in this file is executable. Lower archived/stale active-task sections are historical context only and must not be executed unless Prime/Codex promotes them back to the top of the file.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: add waiver and approval record validation to the Aegis route-gate runtime slice.

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/aegis.py`, `tests/test_aegis.py`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

Task: extend the pure Aegis gate validators so any gate that accepts a waiver, human acknowledgment, premium-cost approval, or Tier 4 approval requires structured evidence: actor, scope, timestamp, reason, and either expiration or evidence reference when applicable. A bare boolean must not satisfy the gate.

Tests:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_aegis.py -q` — All 172 tests passed (73 legacy evidence/proof trail tests + 99 gate validators)

Completion: completed 2026-06-13 17:35 -05:00.

Ready for Codex Review:

- Commits: `a4826c14` (completed implementation), merged and pushed as `d15c83e0`
- Files: `meridian_core/aegis.py`, `tests/test_aegis.py`
- Tests: all 172 passed
- Implementation:
  1. Added `WaiverRecord` dataclass with fields: waiver_id, actor, scope, timestamp, reason, optional expiration/evidence_url, and `is_valid()` method checking all required fields are non-empty strings
  2. Added `ApprovalRecord` dataclass with fields: approval_id, actor, scope, timestamp, reason, optional expiration, and `is_valid()` method
  3. Updated `gate_tier3_dual_lane_requirement()` to accept `waiver_record: WaiverRecord | None` instead of bare boolean; only demote to Tier 2 if `waiver_record.is_valid()` returns True
  4. Updated `gate_cost_exposure()` to accept `approval_record: ApprovalRecord | None` for Tier 2+ premium cost cases; only allow if `approval_record.is_valid()` returns True
  5. Added 6 new test cases validating waiver/approval validation (bare boolean blocks, valid records allow, invalid records block)

## Next Candidate Task

Goal: add Aegis gate summary helpers for Relay/Bifrost display after waiver/approval validation clears review.

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/aegis.py`, `tests/test_aegis.py`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: repair Relay-Aegis risk/proof gate contract contradictions found by Codex Reviews B.

Allowed files only: `docs/relay-aegis-risk-proof-gates.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

Task: update `docs/relay-aegis-risk-proof-gates.md` so the runtime-test contract is internally consistent with `docs/relay-completeness-audit.md`, `docs/relay-heartbeat-model-routing-logic.md`, and `docs/model-harness-v2-contract.md`. Fix these focused issues only:

- Tier 2 DeepSeek wording currently says validation pending is allowed, but the DeepSeek gate and Model Harness contract require `external_review_status == PASSED` before DeepSeek can serve Tier 2 when external review is required.
- Tier 2 aggregator wording currently says "Aggregator block", but the route logic and Model Harness contract allow Tier 2 aggregator routes for review/exploration when proof/trust metadata is explicit; only Tier 3+ aggregator authority is blocked.
- Waiver and approval semantics reference explicit waiver, human acknowledgment, and user approval, but the Relay/Aegis input and decision-record shape do not require waiver/approval evidence fields. Add the minimal required fields so runtime tests can validate actor, scope, timestamp, reason, and expiration/evidence without accepting a bare boolean.

Tests: docs-only; no pytest required unless runtime files are changed.

Completion: completed 2026-06-13 15:48 -05:00.

Ready for Codex Review:

- Commit: `0a5ed589` (merge) containing repair commit `30c62e90`
- Files: `docs/relay-aegis-risk-proof-gates.md`
- Tests: not required (docs-only)
- Repairs applied:
  1. Tier 2 Per-Tier table: updated DeepSeek from "validation pending allowed" to "requires PASSED"; updated Aggregator from "block" to "OK (with proof)"
  2. Aggregator Authority Gate: clarified Tier 2 allowance with explicit proof (code review + metadata) and known selected_model; only Tier 3+ blocked unconditionally
  3. Waiver/Approval Records section: added with JSON schema for waiver_record and approval_record, including required fields (actor, scope, timestamp, reason, optional expiration/evidence)
  4. Integration section: added waiver_record and approval_record to Relay inputs
- Internal consistency verified against relay-completeness-audit.md, relay-heartbeat-model-routing-logic.md, and model-harness-v2-contract.md

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: translate Relay completeness into Aegis risk/proof gates.

Worktree: `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\build-4-aegis`.

Allowed files only: `docs/relay-aegis-risk-proof-gates.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

Required sources: `docs/relay-completeness-audit.md`, `docs/relay-heartbeat-model-routing-logic.md`, `docs/deepseek-validation-benchmark-plan.md`, `docs/model-harness-v2-contract.md`, and existing Aegis docs.

Task: create a docs-only gate contract that tells Prime/Aegis when a Relay route is allowed, dual-laned, demoted, blocked, or human-gated. Cover account-first routing, API fallback, aggregator last-resort use, context/session reset triggers, Tier 3 independent dual-model requirement, Tier 4 human gate, vendor/account risk, no-silent fallback, proof references, and explicit stop conditions. Do not edit runtime code, FileMap, Bifrost, review queues, or worker branches.

Tests: none required, docs-only.

Completion: completed 2026-06-01 15:23 -06:00.

Ready for Codex Review:

- Commit: `a8a7aca8`
- Files: `docs/relay-aegis-risk-proof-gates.md`
- Tests: not required (docs-only)
- Gate categories: unknown route class, missing exact model ID, Tier 3 dual-lane, unknown proof, unsafe fallback, unvalidated DeepSeek, aggregator authority, account/session risk, cost exposure (9 gates total)
- Per-tier enforcement and stop conditions defined
- Integration with Relay routing and Model Harness metadata specified

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: convert the Aegis risk/proof gate contract into bounded runtime test cases.

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/aegis.py`, `tests/test_aegis.py`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

Task: implement the first Aegis runtime/test slice for the reviewed Relay-Aegis risk/proof gate contract. Add typed or helper-level proof gates for unknown route class, missing exact model id, Tier 3 dual-lane requirement, unsafe fallback, missing proof refs, unvalidated DeepSeek, aggregator authority limits, account/session risk, and cost exposure. Keep it pure and deterministic. Do not call models, inspect accounts, move branches, edit Relay runtime, edit Bifrost, or touch Polaris.

Tests:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_aegis.py -q` — All 166 tests passed (73 legacy evidence/proof trail tests + 93 new gate validator tests)

Completion: committed only allowed files, pushed to `origin/main`, now marking Ready for Codex Review.

Ready for Codex Review:

- Commit: `ad46acc3` (contains efdcb005 + other parallel work)
- Files: `meridian_core/aegis.py`, `tests/test_aegis.py`
- Tests: all 166 passed
- Gate implementations: 9 pure, deterministic validators with ALLOW/DEMOTE/BLOCK decisions
  1. Unknown Route Class Gate - validates route_class enum
  2. Missing Exact Model ID Gate - tier-dependent version checking
  3. Tier 3 Dual-Lane Requirement Gate - enforces dual-lane for Tier 3
  4. Unknown Proof Requirement Gate - validates proof_required per tier
  5. Unsafe Fallback Gate - blocks silent fallback, validates blockers
  6. Unvalidated DeepSeek Gate - validates external review status
  7. Aggregator Authority Gate - blocks aggregator for Tier 3+
  8. Account/Session Risk Gate - validates account and session state
  9. Cost Exposure Gate - validates premium cost routes
- New test classes: 9 test classes with 93 tests total (allow/demote/block paths)
- Integration: gates are standalone pure functions; ready for Relay/Aegis runtime binding

## Next Candidate Task

Goal: bind Aegis gate outputs into Relay decision-record proof after the runtime tests clear review.

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/aegis.py`, `tests/test_aegis.py`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: write the Federation Harness horizon plan as the V2 planning entry point for later multi-Meridian and multi-user collaboration.

Allowed files only: `docs/federation-harness-horizon.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

Task: create `docs/federation-harness-horizon.md`.

Cover:

- Why Federation is horizon/V3 runtime but belongs in V2 planning.
- How one Meridian should discover another Meridian without sharing unsafe state by default.
- User/project permission boundaries for collaboration.
- Prime-to-Prime handoff concepts: project summary, task request, proof packet, review result, and refusal/blocker.
- Shared work principles: no silent branch movement, no shared worktree, no hidden account-based automation, explicit project/user consent before cross-Meridian action.
- Future UI implication: Federation appears as a harness panel, not as permanent top navigation.
- Out of V2 scope: network protocol, auth implementation, shared mutable project state, and public marketplace.

Tests: none required, docs-only.

Completion: coordinator completed this Federation planning slice in `e37030e`.

Ready for Codex Review:

- Files: `docs/federation-harness-horizon.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`
- Tests: not required (docs-only)
- Commit: `e37030e`

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: write a Prime workflow/sub-agent usage checklist for harness offloading.

Allowed files only: `docs/workflow-subagent-usage-checklist.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

Task: convert the workflow/sub-agent architecture note into an operational checklist Prime can use when deciding whether Echo, Atlas, Aegis, Relay, Bifrost, or Session Lifecycle work should run in a separate workflow context.

Completion:

- Coordinator completed this docs-only checklist on 2026-05-31.
- Files changed: `docs/workflow-subagent-usage-checklist.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.
- Tests: not required (docs-only).
- Commit: `ac9cef8`.

Ready for Codex Review.

## ~~Coordinator Override - Active Now (COMPLETED 2026-05-31 08:55 -06:00)~~

~~Goal: write the Claude Workflows sub-agent architecture note.~~

~~Allowed files only: `docs/workflows-subagent-harness-architecture.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.~~

~~Task: create a high-level architecture note for using Claude Workflows/sub-agents as separate context windows for harness work. Cover which harnesses should run as workflows, what state Prime keeps locally, what each workflow returns, how this protects Prime's context window, and how it maps to Meridian's long-term harness design. This supersedes the completed Prime Autonomy contract slice.~~

~~Tests: none required, docs-only.~~

~~Completion: commit only this architecture slice, push, update Obsidian, and mark Ready for Codex Review.~~

**Ready for Codex Review**
- Commit: `17d8d90`
- Files: `docs/workflows-subagent-harness-architecture.md`
- Tests: not required (docs-only)

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: write the DeepSeek validation benchmark plan.

Allowed files only: `docs/deepseek-validation-benchmark-plan.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

Task: define the benchmark plan Meridian will use before DeepSeek can move beyond candidate provider status. Cover direct API proof, Q-mode prompt-payload flatness, small coding tasks, docs tasks, failure modes, required Codex review proof, demotion triggers, and why DeepSeek cannot clear reviews, move branches, or receive autonomous coding authority until the gate passes.

Completion:

- Coordinator completed this docs-only benchmark plan on 2026-05-31.
- Files changed: `docs/deepseek-validation-benchmark-plan.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.
- Tests: not required (docs-only).
- Commit: `a9695d1`.

Ready for Codex Review.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Passed Codex Review

Goal: write the Model Harness V2 metadata contract.

Allowed files only: `docs/model-harness-v2-contract.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

Task: create the docs contract for provider capability metadata and prompt-drag telemetry fields that Build 1's `meridian_core/model_adapter.py` runtime slice should implement. Cover Claude, OpenAI, DeepSeek direct API, trust state, context/prompt budgets, route ownership, direct-vs-aggregator evidence, prompt payload snapshot references, allowed/blocked task types, external-review requirements, and Aegis/Relay policy binding.

Completion:

- Salvaged by coordinator from contaminated main-checkout Build 4 commit `2bfaf6f`; read-check spam and dirty main state were not imported.
- Files changed: `docs/model-harness-v2-contract.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.
- Tests: not required (docs-only).
- Commit: this coordinator salvage commit.

Passed Codex Reviews B. Build 4 may proceed to the DeepSeek direct-provider adapter implementation handoff.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: write the DeepSeek direct-provider adapter implementation handoff.

Allowed files only: `docs/deepseek-direct-provider-implementation-handoff.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`.

Task: after `docs/model-harness-v2-contract.md` lands and clears review, write a bounded implementation handoff for adding direct DeepSeek provider metadata/routing through Relay and Aegis. Cover environment variable names, direct-vs-aggregator proof, candidate trust state, prompt payload snapshot evidence, Q-mode flatness proof, blocked authorities, tests expected, and which runtime files should be touched by the later implementation lane.

Tests: not required for this docs-only handoff.

Completion: completed 2026-05-31 per handoff content; file restored 2026-06-01 after accidental deletion by Reviews B idle read (a48771d).

Ready for Codex Review:

- Files: `docs/deepseek-direct-provider-implementation-handoff.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`
- Tests: not required (docs-only)
- Commit: f4a5697

This file is the standing assignment queue for Build 4.

Build 4 is the Opus high-level thinking lane. It should work on architecture, capabilities, strategy, naming, review frameworks, and synthesis. It should not implement runtime code unless Codex explicitly assigns a code slice later.

When idle, check this file every 30 seconds. If there is an active task below, execute it. If the task is complete, commit and push your slice, update Obsidian, then report completion in your session and return to polling this file.

Rules:

- This session must behave as a live worker, not a one-shot handoff. After completing a task, return to this file and keep polling every 30 seconds.
- If there is no Active Task, do not stop. Append a Read Checks entry, wait 30 seconds, pull latest, and check again.
- Always pull latest `origin/main` before editing.
- Every time you check/read this file, add a timestamped entry to the Read Checks section.
- Every time you modify this file or complete a task from it, add a timestamped entry to the Write/Completion Log section.
- Every minute while idle, check for cross-check activity relevant to your slice: review notes, Codex findings, Aegis findings, failing tests, or Obsidian build log updates.
- If cross-check activity affects your task, record it in this file's Cross-Check Activity section and address it before starting unrelated work.
- After completing a task, mark the slice `Ready for Codex Review` with commit hash, files changed, and tests run.
- Do not perform your own Codex review. A separate Codex Reviews lane owns independent review, findings, and repair routing.
- If the Codex Reviews lane writes a repair task into this file, complete that repair before taking unrelated work.
- After every three completed task-changing commits, pause normal build work until the Codex Reviews lane records a cadence review result.
- Use local time with timezone when possible.
- Own only the files listed in the active task.
- Do not edit Build 1, Build 2, or Build 3 live queue files.
- Do not edit runtime code unless the active task explicitly allows it.
- Do not edit files owned by another active build task.
- Keep scope tight.
- Run the requested tests if the task calls for tests.
- Commit only your slice.
- Push to `origin/main`.
- Update Obsidian build notes in `G:\My Drive\Aesop Academy\Obsidian\Meridian_Build`.
- Mark completed slices `Ready for Codex Review` in this file. Include commit hash, files changed, and tests run so `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` can clear or route repairs.

  - **Review Console Harness:** human-gate panel visibility and action routing.
  - **Beacon Harness:** liveness/staleness indicators.
  - **Relay Harness:** lane/session status without prompt drag.
  - **Aegis Harness:** proof/gate status and failed-check visibility.
  - **FileMap Harness:** discovery coverage for new UI/runtime files.
- Include proof expectations for each item: targeted tests, browser/manual visual checks, FileMap checks, and review gates.
- Include what remains explicitly out of V1: Echo memory engine, Atlas/RAG, multi-user federation, public/account adapter strategy, and vendor-specific model presets.
- Include stop conditions for stale data, shared-worktree collision, failed proof gate, or UI rendering regression.
- Keep this docs-only and implementation-facing.
- Do not edit runtime code.
- Do not edit FileMap.
- Do not edit other live queues.

  - **Bifrost Harness:** static scaffold, render model, local preview command, browser verification.
  - **Prime:** cockpit snapshot provider and current intention.
  - **Review Console Harness:** gate list and approval actions.
  - **Beacon Harness:** liveness/age/stale signals.
  - **Relay Harness:** lane/session dispatch status.
  - **Aegis Harness:** proof/gate status.
  - **Build/Queue Harness:** lane strip and progress-event source.

  - input dependency
  - output artifact/module
  - test/proof expectation
  - what can run in parallel
  - what must wait for review/FileMap registration
- Keep the sequence V1-scoped. Do not pull Echo, Atlas, federation, or public/provider strategy into V1.
