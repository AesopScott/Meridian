# Live Build 4 Queue

This file is the standing assignment queue for Build 4.

Build 4 is the Opus high-level thinking lane. It should work on architecture, capabilities, strategy, naming, review frameworks, and synthesis. It should not implement runtime code unless Codex explicitly assigns a code slice later.

When idle, check this file every 30 seconds. If there is an active task below, execute it. If the task is complete, commit and push your slice, update Obsidian, then report completion in your session and return to polling this file.

Rules:

- This session must behave as a live worker, not a one-shot handoff. After completing a task, return to this file and keep polling every 30 seconds.
- If there is no Active Task, do not stop. Append a Read Checks entry, wait 30 seconds, pull latest, and check again.
- Always pull latest `origin/main` before editing.
- Every time you check/read this file, add a timestamped entry to the Read Checks section.
- Every time you modify this file or complete a task from it, add a timestamped entry to the Write/Completion Log section.
- Every minute while idle, check for cross-check activity relevant to your slice: review notes, Codex findings, Aegis findings, failing tests, or Obsidian build log updates.
- If cross-check activity affects your task, record it in this file's Cross-Check Activity section and address it before starting unrelated work.
- After completing a task, mark the slice `Ready for Codex Review` with commit hash, files changed, and tests run.
- Do not perform your own Codex review. A separate Codex Reviews lane owns independent review, findings, and repair routing.
- If the Codex Reviews lane writes a repair task into this file, complete that repair before taking unrelated work.
- After every three completed task-changing commits, pause normal build work until the Codex Reviews lane records a cadence review result.
- Use local time with timezone when possible.
- Own only the files listed in the active task.
- Do not edit Build 1, Build 2, or Build 3 live queue files.
- Do not edit runtime code unless the active task explicitly allows it.
- Do not edit files owned by another active build task.
- Keep scope tight.
- Run the requested tests if the task calls for tests.
- Commit only your slice.
- Push to `origin/main`.
- Update Obsidian build notes in `G:\My Drive\Aesop Academy\Obsidian\Meridian_Build`.
- Mark completed slices `Ready for Codex Review` in this file. Include commit hash, files changed, and tests run so `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` can clear or route repairs.

## Codex Review Cadence

After every three completed changes/commits by Build 4, request a Codex review check before starting another task. The review check should automatically repair actionable findings in Build 4-owned files, rerun relevant tests if any, commit/push fixes, and report the result here.

```text
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 4 Codex review requested after commits <hash1>, <hash2>, <hash3>
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 4 Codex review finding: <severity>; details: <short note>
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 4 Codex review repair: commit <hash>; tests <result>; details: <short note>
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 4 Codex review result: pass/no actionable findings/fixed; details: <short note>
2026-05-30 11:31 -06:00 - Build 4 Codex review requested after commits 951a6ed, 1db1b23, d29cca6
2026-05-30 11:37 -06:00 - Build 4 Codex review finding: CRITICAL; docs/meridian-capabilities-architecture-map.md claims Prompt Metrics "not built" — prompt_metrics.py exists with domain types; repair: reclassify as domain slice
2026-05-30 11:37 -06:00 - Build 4 Codex review finding: CRITICAL; capabilities map says RelayRoute does not carry budget field — relay.py already carries prompt_budget: PromptBudgetPlan; repair: correct claim
2026-05-30 11:37 -06:00 - Build 4 Codex review finding: CRITICAL; Review Console marked "planned" — review_console.py domain model exists; repair: reclassify as domain slice
2026-05-30 11:37 -06:00 - Build 4 Codex review finding: HIGH; surface contract card taxonomy mismatches review_console.py enums; repair: add domain-model alignment section to contract
2026-05-30 11:37 -06:00 - Build 4 Codex review finding: HIGH; contract disposition actions (Defer, Override, Escalate) not in current domain model; repair: table distinguishing current vs. future actions added
2026-05-30 11:37 -06:00 - Build 4 Codex review repair: commit 7792243 (piggy-backed on Build 1 read check — edits were staged and picked up); tests not required (docs-only); all 3 CRITICAL + 2 HIGH repaired
2026-05-30 11:41 -06:00 - Build 4 Codex review result: fixed; 3 CRITICAL + 2 HIGH addressed; capabilities map now accurately reflects domain slice state for all 10 capabilities; Review Console contract aligned to domain enums

## Active Task

Current Active Task (supersedes any stale text below):

Goal: define Prime orchestration harness state model.

Allowed files only:

- `docs/prime-orchestration-state-model.md`

Task:

- Write a strategic architecture note that turns the current live queue process into Prime-native state.
- Cover:
  - lane registry
  - active task state
  - review checkpoint state
  - review round scope
  - repair routing
  - Ready for Codex Review markers
  - lane clearing and cadence pauses
  - how this maps to Beacon, Bifrost, Relay, Aegis, and the Review Console
  - what remains markdown prototype versus what should become Python domain objects
- Use `docs/prime-orchestration-harness-prototype.md` as source context, but do not edit it.
- Keep it candid and implementation-guiding, not marketing copy.
- Do not edit runtime code.
- Do not edit FileMap.
- Do not edit package exports.
- Do not edit other live queues.

Tests:

- No tests required. This is docs-only.

Completion:

- Commit only this docs slice.
- Push to `origin/main`.
- Update Obsidian.
- Mark this slice `Ready for Codex Review` with commit hash, files changed, and tests run.

Stale prior text:

**Ready for Codex Review**
- Commit: `1d17fa1`
- Files: `docs/prime-orchestration-state-model.md`
- Tests: not required (docs-only)

(Previous slice `3cbf336` `docs/v0-build-readiness-map.md` also pending Codex Reviews sweep.)

No active task. Polling.
