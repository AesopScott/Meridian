# V2 Backend Completion Audit - 2026-06-08

## Purpose

This audit records the current backend-owned V2 build state after the June 8 backend restart wave. It is not a declaration that all of Meridian V2 is complete. It separates reviewed backend closure from UI-owned Runtime Logic wiring, live operations, and post-V2/V3 work.

**2026-06-10 update:** The later backend restart/promotion wave converted the
remaining tracker baselines into reviewed implementation/provenance closure.
Use the count below for current backend build reports; the historical June 8
`36/45 + 9 baseline` line is superseded.

## Current Count

Authoritative count source: `docs/v2-progress-tracker.md`.

| Measure | Count |
|---|---:|
| Built and review-cleared | 45 |
| Built awaiting review | 0 |
| Contract baseline | 0 |
| Needs build | 0 |
| Total V2 tracker items | 45 |

Status line for reports:

```text
V2 backend tracker: 45/45 built and review-cleared, 0 awaiting review, 0/45 contract baseline, 0 remaining V2 backend build items.
```

## What This Proves

- The current V2 tracker has no backend-owned item in `Needs Build`.
- The active build queues do not expose a current executable backend worker task at the top of Build 1 or Build 3. Build 2, Build 4, and Build 5 top sections are completed/promoted historical work unless a coordinator promotes a new active block above them.
- The recent backend restart wave promoted reviewed backend slices for Prime typed Echo/Atlas context ingestion, Aegis backend Runtime Logic snapshot, Prime/Beacon advisory liveness input, and Beacon/Aegis harness-stage status synchronization.
- FileMap discoverability was updated for the promoted backend runtime and documentation surfaces.

## What This Does Not Prove

- It does not prove full Meridian V2 product completion.
- It does not prove UI-owned Runtime Logic panels are complete.
- It does not prove live operations are enabled or safe.
- It does not authorize backend sessions to edit `index.html`, `scripts/meridian-model-bridge.js`, Bifrost/Electron renderer wiring, bridge routes, or UI implementation files.
- It does not convert post-V2 Prime/live orchestration, live Echo/Atlas query wiring, live provider telemetry, live workflow execution, or operations-gated controls into V2 backend scope.

## Converted Contract Baseline Disposition

The V2 tracker now keeps 0 items as open `Contract Baseline`. The 9 former
baseline rows remain in `docs/v2-progress-tracker.md` as converted provenance:
they are accepted V2 backend/tracker closure, not duplicate open build tasks.

Several baseline areas already have reviewed runtime work represented under
`Built and Review-Cleared V2 Capabilities`; the converted provenance rows
record why no additional backend worker is implied. Do not count those rows as
backend implementation blockers without an explicit tracker update that names a
new runtime requirement.

| Baseline item | Tracker owner | Current disposition | Backend action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Echo + Memory Contract | Echo Harness | Contract remains accepted architecture provenance; Echo runtime and FileMap integration are already review-cleared above it in the tracker. | No backend worker unless a new Echo runtime requirement is moved into `Needs Build`. |
| Echo + Repository Integration | Echo Harness | Contract-defined local storage/query abstraction remains accepted baseline; promoted Echo runtime covers deterministic memory records, query, ranking, pinning, and project filtering. | No duplicate implementation task from the baseline row alone. |
| Atlas + Retrieval Contract | Atlas Harness | Contract remains accepted architecture provenance; Atlas ranking, FileMap integration, and Atlas Workflow Adapter are already review-cleared above it. | No backend worker unless V2 tracker explicitly asks for another Atlas runtime slice. |
| Session Lifecycle + Workflow Contract | Session Lifecycle Harness | Contract is represented by reviewed Workflow Dispatch and Atlas Workflow Adapter capabilities plus Session Lifecycle runtime/proof slices. | No backend worker unless tracker names a new workflow/runtime requirement. |
| Compass + Project Boundary Contract | Compass Harness | Contract is represented by reviewed Compass project definition, bounds/scope, project difference, and cross-project handoff runtime slices. | No backend worker unless tracker reopens Compass runtime build. |
| Model Harness + DeepSeek Validation Gate | Relay/Model Harness | Baseline remains the trust/authority contract; DeepSeek validation/transport authority runtime is review-cleared, with autonomous coding/review/branch authority still denied. | No backend worker to expand DeepSeek authority without new proof/tracker entry. |
| Model Harness + Metadata Contract, including Per-Call GOAL/Intent disposition | Relay/Model Harness | Contract is represented by reviewed model metadata binding and Relay/Model evidence surfaces. The per-call GOAL/Intent line is a sub-disposition of this converted provenance row, preserving the open Relay/Model baseline count at 0. | No backend worker unless tracker names a new metadata runtime gap; do not move per-call dispatch intent into Prime. |
| Bifrost + Voice Command Contract | Bifrost Harness | Contract is review-cleared and FileMap-registered; visible voice surface work belongs to UI/Bifrost ownership unless tracker names a backend data-model gap. | Backend reports dependency only; does not edit UI. |
| Bifrost + Balance/Payload Contract | Bifrost Harness | Contract is review-cleared and FileMap-registered; reviewed backend/view-model proof covers provider balance and prompt payload visibility above. | No backend worker unless tracker names a new backend evidence gap. |

## Harness Matrix Findings

Authoritative stage source: `docs/harness-stage-checklist.md`.

| Harness area | Backend status | Remaining dependency |
|---|---|---|
| Prime | Backend and Runtime Logic UI review-cleared; operations not live. | Post-V2 live source refs and operations gating. |
| Relay / Model | Backend review-cleared; mechanics remain Relay/Model-owned. | Post-V2 live provider telemetry and operations gating. |
| Compass | Runtime backend review-cleared. | Post-V2 Prime/live orchestration integration or operations gating. |
| Vulcan / Session Lifecycle | Runtime backend review-cleared; command execution not live. | Post-V2 live session operation gating and recovery UX. |
| Aegis | Backend core and Prime risk binding review-cleared. | UI-owned Runtime Logic completion and live proof packet surfaces. |
| Echo | Backend core review-cleared; typed Prime ingestion is supported when supplied. | Post-V2 live memory feed into Prime runtime packet. |
| Atlas | Backend core, FileMap integration, and Workflow adapter review-cleared; typed Prime ingestion is supported when supplied. | Post-V2 live retrieval feed into Prime runtime packet. |
| Beacon | Prime advisory input review-cleared; Beacon core remains partial and observes only. | UI-owned heartbeat/liveness Runtime Logic surface; no execution authority. |
| Workflow | Dispatch and Atlas adapter review-cleared; no live workflow execution. | Post-V2 Prime binding and live workflow execution gates. |

Rows for Security/Guardrails, Ratchet/Tool, Source/Git, Vision/Browser, and Autonomy/Release remain planned or reserved and are not queued as V2 backend build items in the tracker.

## UI-Owned Dependencies

The following are dependencies for complete user-visible V2 operation, but they are not owned by this backend session:

- Aegis Runtime Logic UI completion.
- Beacon heartbeat/liveness Runtime Logic surface.
- UI-to-backend bridge/render wiring.
- Electron/renderer implementation work.
- UI checklist progress and remaining planned rows.

Backend sessions may report these as dependencies, but must not build them unless Scott explicitly reassigns ownership.

## Next Backend Action

No new backend implementation worker should be launched solely from stale historical queue text. Before assigning a new backend task, update the tracker or harness matrix with a named backend-owned requirement, allowed files, proof commands, and review gates.

If Scott asks whether backend V2 is complete, answer:

```text
The tracked backend build has 45/45 reviewed implementation/provenance items, 0/45 accepted contract baselines, and no current Needs Build item. Full V2 product completion still requires checking UI-owned Runtime Logic wiring and visible operation dependencies outside this backend lane.
```
