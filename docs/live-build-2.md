# Live Build 2 Queue

This file is the standing assignment queue for Build 2.

When idle, check this file every 30 seconds. If there is an active task below, execute it. If the task is complete, commit and push your slice, update Obsidian, then report completion in your session and return to polling this file.

Rules:

- Always pull latest `origin/main` before editing.
- Every time you check/read this file, add a timestamped entry to the Read Checks section.
- Every time you modify this file or complete a task from it, add a timestamped entry to the Write/Completion Log section.
- Every minute while idle, check for cross-check activity relevant to your slice: review notes, Codex findings, Aegis findings, failing tests, or Obsidian build log updates.
- If cross-check activity affects your task, record it in this file's Cross-Check Activity section and address it before starting unrelated work.
- After every three completed changes/commits from this build session, stop normal build work and request a Codex review check before taking another build task.
- The Codex review check must automatically repair actionable findings in your owned files, rerun required tests, commit/push the repair slice, and report findings/fixes back in this file's heartbeat sections.
- Record Codex review requests, findings, repairs, and outcomes in the Codex Review Cadence section.
- Use local time with timezone when possible.
- Own only the files listed in the active task.
- Do not edit Build 1 or Build 3 live queue files.
- Do not edit files owned by another active build task.
- Keep scope tight.
- Run the requested tests.
- Commit only your slice.
- Push to `origin/main`.
- Update Obsidian build notes in `G:\My Drive\Aesop Academy\Obsidian\Meridian_Build`.

## Read Checks

Append entries here when this file is checked while idle.

```text
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 2 checked queue; status: idle/running/blocked
```

## Write/Completion Log

Append entries here when this file is modified or an active task is completed.

```text
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 2 completed <task>; commit <hash>; tests <result>
2026-05-30 10:33 -06:00 - Codex assigned Prompt Metrics package API + FileMap exposure; commit pending; tests pending
```

## Cross-Check Activity

Append entries here when you check or act on cross-check activity.

```text
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 2 cross-check: none/finding/fix; details: <short note>
```

## Codex Review Cadence

After every three completed changes/commits by Build 2, request a Codex review check before starting another task. The review check should automatically repair actionable findings in Build 2-owned files, rerun tests, commit/push fixes, and report the result here.

```text
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 2 Codex review requested after commits <hash1>, <hash2>, <hash3>
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 2 Codex review finding: <severity>; details: <short note>
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 2 Codex review repair: commit <hash>; tests <result>; details: <short note>
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 2 Codex review result: pass/no actionable findings/fixed; details: <short note>
```

## Active Task

Goal: expose Prompt Metrics as a stable package capability and FileMap entry.

Allowed files only:

- `meridian_core/__init__.py`
- `tests/test_package_api.py`
- `meridian_core/filemap.py`
- `tests/test_filemap.py`
- `docs/FileMap.md`

Context:

- Prompt Metrics domain code already exists in `meridian_core/prompt_metrics.py`.
- `docs/FileMap.md` already has a Prompt Metrics row.
- Root package exports currently include Prompt Budget but not Prompt Metrics.

Task:

- Export these stable Prompt Metrics names from package root:
  - `PromptMetricSample`
  - `PromptMetricSummary`
  - `PromptPerformanceStatus`
  - `summarize_prompt_metrics`
- Add package API import smoke coverage.
- Ensure FileMap required-path coverage includes:
  - `meridian_core/prompt_metrics.py`
  - `docs/relay-prompt-metrics-integration-brief.md`
- Keep exactly one `meridian_core/prompt_metrics.py` row in `docs/FileMap.md`.
- If the FileMap already contains the row, refine only if needed.
- No runtime behavior changes.
- No Relay edits.
- No UI.
- No persistence.

Tests:

```text
python -m pytest tests/test_package_api.py tests/test_filemap.py -q
python -m pytest -q
```

Completion:

- Commit only this slice.
- Push to `origin/main`.
- Update Obsidian.
- Report commit hash and test count in your session.
