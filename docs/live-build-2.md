# Live Build 2 Queue

This file is the standing assignment queue for Build 2.

When idle, check this file every 30 seconds. If there is an active task below, execute it. If the task is complete, commit and push your slice, update Obsidian, then report completion in your session and return to polling this file.

Rules:

- This session must behave as a live worker, not a one-shot handoff. After completing a task, return to this file and keep polling every 30 seconds.
- If there is no Active Task, do not stop. Append a Read Checks entry, wait 30 seconds, pull latest, and check again.
- Always pull latest `origin/main` before editing.
- Every time you check/read this file, add a timestamped entry to the Read Checks section.
- Every time you modify this file or complete a task from it, add a timestamped entry to the Write/Completion Log section.
- Every minute while idle, check for cross-check activity relevant to your slice: review notes, Codex findings, Aegis findings, failing tests, or Obsidian build log updates.
- If cross-check activity affects your task, record it in this file's Cross-Check Activity section and address it before starting unrelated work.
- After completing a task, mark the slice `Ready for Codex Review` with commit hash, files changed, and tests run.
- Do not perform your own Codex review. A separate Codex Reviews lane owns independent review, findings, and repair routing.
- If the Codex Reviews lane writes a repair task into this file, complete that repair before taking unrelated work.
- After every three completed task-changing commits, pause normal build work until the Codex Reviews lane records a cadence review result.
- Use local time with timezone when possible.
- Own only the files listed in the active task.
- Do not edit Build 1 or Build 3 live queue files.
- Do not edit files owned by another active build task.
- Keep scope tight.
- Run the requested tests.
- Commit only your slice.
- Push to `origin/main`.
- Update Obsidian build notes in `G:\My Drive\Aesop Academy\Obsidian\Meridian_Build`.
- Mark completed slices `Ready for Codex Review` in this file. Include commit hash, files changed, and tests run so `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` can clear or route repairs.

## Cross-Check Activity

Append entries here when you check or act on cross-check activity.

```text
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 2 cross-check: none/finding/fix; details: <short note>
2026-05-30 10:42 -06:00 - Build 2 cross-check: no actionable findings in commit 6d51710; targeted tests 103 passed.
2026-05-30 10:54 -06:00 - Build 2 cross-check: no blocking findings in commit e27da72; targeted tests 239 passed.
2026-05-30 11:15 -06:00 - Build 2 cross-check: no blocking findings in commit 9c52688; targeted tests 95 passed (test_package_api.py + test_review_console.py).
2026-05-30 11:20 -06:00 - Build 2 cross-check: no blocking findings in commit 9c52688; targeted tests 140 passed.
2026-05-30 11:45 -06:00 - Build 2 cross-check: no blocking findings in commit f2f69ff; targeted tests 11 passed (test_package_api.py).
2026-05-30 12:35 -06:00 - Build 2 cross-check: Codex found 3 MEDIUM findings in 88fbecb/f2f69ff/e73b840; repaired 2 (test __all__ membership, stale candidates text); 1 deferred (prompt-packet-package-api-note.md not in allowed files); commit 253e505; tests 688 passed.
2026-05-30 11:43 -06:00 - Build 2 cross-check finding: docs/prompt-packet-package-api-note.md still says callers use is_valid and validation_errors, but PromptPacket raises PromptPacketValidationError and has no such public attributes.
```

## Codex Review Cadence

After every three completed changes/commits by Build 2, request a Codex review check before starting another task. The review check should automatically repair actionable findings in Build 2-owned files, rerun tests, commit/push fixes, and report the result here.

```text
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 2 Codex review requested after commits <hash1>, <hash2>, <hash3>
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 2 Codex review finding: <severity>; details: <short note>
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 2 Codex review repair: commit <hash>; tests <result>; details: <short note>
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 2 Codex review result: pass/no actionable findings/fixed; details: <short note>
2026-05-30 11:15 -06:00 - Build 2 Codex review requested after commits 6d51710, e27da72, 9c52688 (Prompt Metrics package exposure, Review Console bridge, package API export)
2026-05-30 11:20 -06:00 - Build 2 Codex review result: pass/no actionable findings; package API export cleared.
2026-05-30 12:25 -06:00 - Build 2 Codex review requested after commits 88fbecb, f2f69ff, e73b840 (PromptPacket planning note, PromptPacket export, surface note update)
2026-05-30 12:35 -06:00 - Build 2 Codex review finding: MEDIUM (3 findings — see Cross-Check Activity)
2026-05-30 12:35 -06:00 - Build 2 Codex review repair: commit 253e505; tests 688 passed; repaired 2/3 findings; 1 deferred (out of scope)
2026-05-30 12:35 -06:00 - Build 2 Codex review result: fixed (2 repaired, 1 deferred — no blocking findings remain in allowed files)
```

## Active Task

Goal: repair stale PromptPacket package API note claim.

Allowed files only:

- `docs/prompt-packet-package-api-note.md`

Task:

- Codex reviewed Build 2 commit `4be1117`.
- Finding: the note says callers interact through `is_valid` and `validation_errors`, but the current PromptPacket contract raises `PromptPacketValidationError` during construction and does not expose those public attributes.
- Repair the note so it accurately describes the current exception-based validation contract.
- Keep the change narrow.
- Do not edit `meridian_core/__init__.py`.
- Do not edit package tests.
- Do not edit FileMap.

Tests:

- No tests required. This is docs-only.

Completion:

- Commit only this docs slice.
- Push to `origin/main`.
- Update Obsidian.
- Mark this slice `Ready for Codex Review` with commit hash, files changed, and tests run.
