# Live Build 2 Queue

This file is the standing assignment queue for Build 2.

When idle, check this file every 30 seconds. If there is an active task below, execute it. If the task is complete, commit and push your slice, update Obsidian, then report completion in your session and return to polling this file.

Rules:

- This session must behave as a live worker, not a one-shot handoff. After completing a task, return to this file and keep polling every 30 seconds.
- If there is no Active Task, do not stop. Append a Read Checks entry, wait 30 seconds, pull latest, and check again.
- Always pull latest `origin/main` before editing.
- Every time you check/read this file, add a timestamped entry to the Read Checks section.
- Every time you modify this file or complete a task from it, add a timestamped entry to the Write/Completion Log section.
- Every minute while idle, check for cross-check activity relevant to your slice: review notes, Codex findings, Aegis findings, failing tests, or Obsidian build log updates.
- If cross-check activity affects your task, record it in this file's Cross-Check Activity section and address it before starting unrelated work.
- After every three completed changes/commits from this build session, stop normal build work and request a Codex review check before taking another build task.
- The Codex review check must automatically repair actionable findings in your owned files, rerun required tests, commit/push the repair slice, and report findings/fixes back in this file's heartbeat sections.
- Record Codex review requests, findings, repairs, and outcomes in the Codex Review Cadence section.
- Use local time with timezone when possible.
- Own only the files listed in the active task.
- Do not edit Build 1 or Build 3 live queue files.
- Do not edit files owned by another active build task.
- Keep scope tight.
- Run the requested tests.
- Commit only your slice.
- Push to `origin/main`.
- Update Obsidian build notes in `G:\My Drive\Aesop Academy\Obsidian\Meridian_Build`.

## Codex Review Cadence

After every three completed changes/commits by Build 2, request a Codex review check before starting another task. The review check should automatically repair actionable findings in Build 2-owned files, rerun tests, commit/push fixes, and report the result here.

```text
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 2 Codex review requested after commits <hash1>, <hash2>, <hash3>
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 2 Codex review finding: <severity>; details: <short note>
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 2 Codex review repair: commit <hash>; tests <result>; details: <short note>
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ - Build 2 Codex review result: pass/no actionable findings/fixed; details: <short note>
2026-05-30 11:15 -06:00 - Build 2 Codex review requested after commits 6d51710, e27da72, 9c52688 (Prompt Metrics package exposure, Review Console bridge, package API export)
2026-05-30 11:00 -06:00 - Build 2 Codex review result: pass/no actionable findings; package API export cleared.
```

## Active Task

Goal: create a PromptPacket package API planning note.

Allowed files only:

- `docs/prompt-packet-package-api-note.md`

Context:

- Codex review cleared Build 2 commit `9c52688`.
- Build 1 is repairing PromptPacket validation before it should be exported from package root.
- Build 2 should prepare the export decision, not edit package API yet.

Task:

- Write a short planning note for when PromptPacket should become a root package export.
- Cover:
  - which names might be exported
  - which names should stay internal
  - what tests should exist before export
  - why export should wait until Build 1 validation hardening lands
  - how this relates to `docs/package-api-surface-note.md`
- No code changes.
- No package API edits.
- No FileMap edits.
- No UI.
- No persistence.

Tests:

- No tests required. This is docs-only.

Completion:

- Commit only this slice.
- Push to `origin/main`.
- Update Obsidian.
- Report commit hash and test count in your session.
