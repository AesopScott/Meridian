# Live Build 2 Queue

## Required First Command For Every New Task

You must do all work inside your assigned unique worktree. You are not allowed to write to `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian` main or push/write to `main` without explicit coordinator approval. Do not move data between worktrees, branches, or the main checkout. Do not cherry-pick, copy files, stash-pop across worktrees, merge, rebase, reset, or salvage. If you believe work must move, stop and ask the coordinator. The coordinator may permit it only after verifying `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian` main is clean.

## Queue Authority

Only the first `Coordinator Override - Active Now` block in this file is executable. Lower `Archived` or `Stale prior task` sections are historical context only and must not be executed unless Prime/Codex promotes them back to the top of the file.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: add Session Lifecycle command-preview proof fields for V2 tracker item `Session Lifecycle + Command Plan Proof`.

Worktree: `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\build-2-session-lifecycle`.

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py`, `tests/test_session_lifecycle.py`, `docs/live-build-2.md`.

Task: add deterministic, display-safe command preview proof metadata on top of non-executable command-plan staging/review packets. Include expected transition, queue/worktree/branch context, Aegis gate result/status, executability, rollback/recovery note, target, reason, evidence refs, permission state, UI-review blocker, and `is_executable_now=False` for UI-review staging.

Completion:

- Build 2 completed the command-preview proof field slice in local worktree commit `fa5f2f82`.
- Files changed: `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py`, `tests/test_session_lifecycle.py`.
- Evidence: added frozen `SessionCommandPreviewProof` plus `build_command_preview_proof()` to derive display-safe proof fields from a `SessionCommandStagingReviewPacket` and `SessionLifecycleState`. The preview records target session id, command kind/recommended action, required operation, reason, expected transition, queue file, worktree, branch, Aegis pending status/result, proof requirement, ready flag, non-executability, human UI review requirement, rollback/recovery note, permission state, blockers, and evidence refs without executing recovery or touching process/session/model/UI/FileMap/branch/main/Polaris surfaces.
- Proof: `python -m pytest tests/test_session_lifecycle.py -q` passed with 116 tests; `git diff --check` passed.
- Ready for Codex Review.
- Next Candidate: bind review findings or connect the reviewed command-preview proof fields to Prime/Beacon advisory serialization when routed.

Keep it pure/advisory and serializable only: no restart/resteer/archive execution, process/session/model/provider calls, UI/Bifrost/FileMap side effects, branch/main movement, or Polaris.

Completion:

- Build 2 completed the command-staging Prime/Beacon advisory consumer binding in local worktree commit `0f63b726`.
- Files changed: `meridian_core/prime_autonomy.py`, `meridian_core/beacon.py`, `tests/test_prime_autonomy.py`, `tests/test_beacon.py`.
- Evidence: Prime now consumes `SessionLiveControlCommandPlanStagingRecord` through `select_next_action_from_command_plan_staging_record()` and either surfaces non-executable `ADVISE_SESSION_RECOVERY` review-needed advice when only the UI-review blocker remains or pauses safely when permission/stageability blockers exist. Beacon now serializes the same staging record through `command_plan_staging_advisory_evidence()` with target, command kind, recommended action, required operation, readiness flag, non-executable flag, UI-review gate, permission state, blockers, and evidence refs.
- Proof: `python -m pytest tests/test_prime_autonomy.py tests/test_beacon.py -q` passed with 106 tests; `git diff --check` passed.

- Files changed: `meridian_core/prime_autonomy.py`, `meridian_core/beacon.py`, `tests/test_prime_autonomy.py`, `tests/test_beacon.py`.
- Evidence: Prime now consumes `SessionRecoveryReadinessSummary` through `select_next_action_from_recovery_readiness_summary()` and keeps even readiness-cleared recovery advisory-only behind command-plan staging; blockers and human-gate rationale pause Prime safely. Beacon now serializes the same summary through `recovery_readiness_advisory_evidence()` with readiness status, command kind, recommended action, required operation, ready flag, blockers, and display-safe evidence refs. No recovery, process, model, UI, FileMap, branch/main, or Polaris action is executed.

Task: fix `_permission_unlock_expired_at()` so aware datetimes are normalized with `astimezone(timezone.utc)` before comparison instead of relabeling them with `replace(tzinfo=timezone.utc)`. Add a regression test using a non-UTC aware `timestamp` proving `summarize_session_permission_state()` deterministically records `permission.unlock_expired` when the same instant is after the UTC unlock expiry.

Task: add a narrow deterministic, display-safe binding so Session Lifecycle permission state and command-plan audit evidence can be surfaced to Prime/Beacon as advisory evidence for restart, resteer, branch/worktree movement, recovery, and human-gate decisions. This must not execute movement or session control. Preserve the coordinator-only movement rule: branch/worktree movement stays blocked unless an explicit permission object/evidence says it is allowed. No process inspection, model calls, UI/Bifrost/FileMap edits, Polaris, merge/rebase/reset/cherry-pick, or autonomous movement.

Tests: `python -m pytest tests/test_session_lifecycle.py tests/test_prime_autonomy.py tests/test_beacon.py -q`.

Completion:

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: add command-plan audit evidence serialization edge coverage for Prime advisory output.

Worktree: `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\build-2-session-lifecycle`.

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/prime_autonomy.py`, `tests/test_prime_autonomy.py`, `docs/live-build-2.md`.

Task: extend the reviewed Prime audit-evidence advisory binding with focused edge coverage for missing audit evidence, malformed serialized evidence, permission-boundary blockers, review-gate/human-gate blockers, and deterministic evidence-string formatting. Keep this pure/advisory only: no session spawning, process inspection, model calls, branch/worktree movement, UI/Bifrost/FileMap edits, Polaris, or autonomous movement.

Tests: `python -m pytest tests/test_prime_autonomy.py -q`.

Completion:

- Build 2 completed the Prime audit-evidence edge slice in local worktree commit `d65ddcab`.
- Files changed: `meridian_core/prime_autonomy.py`, `tests/test_prime_autonomy.py`.
- Evidence: malformed serialized audit evidence now falls back to non-executable advisory state; string booleans are parsed deterministically; permission-boundary and review/human-gate blockers remain display-safe evidence; evidence strings keep stable key formatting in `PrimeNextAction.evidence`.
- Proof: `python -m pytest tests/test_prime_autonomy.py -q` passed with 70 tests.
- Ready for Codex Review.
- Next Candidate: bind any review findings from this Prime audit-evidence edge slice before unrelated Session Lifecycle work.

Task: add focused restart/resteer recovery tests now that Codex Reviews A cleared current-main commit `e41851ae`. Prove the Session Lifecycle surface preserves safe recovery decisions around stale heartbeat, context-fill summarize/reset, reasoning-shift transfer/start-new-session, review-gate human approval, and permission-boundary blocking while preserving the reviewed permission invariants.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: repair remaining Session Lifecycle permission-invariant gaps.

Worktree: `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\build-2-session-lifecycle`.

Review findings routed by Codex Reviews A on 2026-06-01 18:21 -06:00:

- HIGH: `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py:144` - `PermissionContext` now has `approved_by_secondary`, `unlock_expiry`, and `task_scope`, but it still has no construction-time invariants enforcing the checklist requirements that temporary unlocks have explicit expiry/task scope and permanent unlocks require Aegis + Scott/two independent approvers (`docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md:123`, `docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md:124`, `docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md:186`, `docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md:187`).
- HIGH: `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py:318` and `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py:397` - `can_accept_work()` checks locked/expired permission state but cannot enforce `task_scope`, and `SessionLifecycleState.can_execute_operation()` bypasses `PermissionContext.can_execute_operation()` so it ignores unlock expiry and task scope entirely. This leaves the prior permission-boundary finding partially open against checklist requirements for expiry, task scope, and approval-scope filtering (`docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md:101`, `docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md:127`, `docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md:153`, `docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md:154`).

Task: enforce the remaining permission invariants. Reject invalid temporary/permanent `PermissionContext` states in construction/helper paths; make `SessionLifecycleState.can_accept_work()` and `can_execute_operation()` enforce expiry and task scope using the session's current task id; and add focused tests proving invalid temporary/permanent permissions are rejected and expired/out-of-scope unlocks cannot accept work or execute operations. Preserve the closed repairs for prompt-sent heartbeat semantics and immutable PrimeAutonomyInput containers. Do not edit UI/Bifrost/FileMap/Polaris or add live process control.

Tests:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_session_lifecycle.py -q`

Completion:

- Build 2 completed the remaining permission-invariant repair in current-main commit `e41851ae`.
- Files changed: `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py`, `tests/test_session_lifecycle.py`.
- Repairs applied: invalid temporary/permanent `PermissionContext` states are rejected; temporary unlocks require expiry and task scope; permanent unlocks require dual approval; work acceptance and operation execution enforce expiry/task scope against the session's current task id.
- Proof: `python -m pytest tests/test_session_lifecycle.py -q` passed with 60 tests from clean main.
- Push: commit is present on `origin/main`.

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py`, `tests/test_session_lifecycle.py`, `docs/live-build-2.md`.

Review findings routed by Codex Reviews A on 2026-06-01 18:14 -06:00:

- HIGH: `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py:144` - `PermissionContext` omits the reviewed checklist fields and invariants for `approved_by_secondary`, `unlock_expiry`, and `task_scope` (`docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md:16`, `docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md:21`, `docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md:22`, `docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md:186`, `docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md:187`). Without expiry/task scope and dual-signer support, temporary unlocks are not timestamp-bound/task-scoped and permanent unlocks cannot require Aegis + Scott approval.
- HIGH: `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py:292` - `SessionLifecycleState.can_accept_work()` ignores `permission_context`, so a healthy locked session can still accept work despite the checklist requiring `can_accept_work()` to be false while permission is locked or an unlock is expired (`docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md:101`, `docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md:151`, `docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md:153`, `docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md:154`).
- MEDIUM: `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py:305` - `heartbeat_stale()` uses `last_queue_read_at` and a minutes threshold, but the permissions checklist defines staleness from `last_prompt_sent_at` with a seconds threshold (`docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md:37`, `docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md:102`, `docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md:132`, `docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md:133`).
- MEDIUM: `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py:206` - `PrimeAutonomyInput` is a frozen dataclass but stores mutable `list`/`dict` fields and `to_dict()` returns those containers by reference at `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py:220` through `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py:223`, violating the immutable/deterministic Prime input requirement (`docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md:147`, `docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md:181`, `docs/session-lifecycle-permissions-implementation-checklist.md:190`).

Task: repair the implementation to match the reviewed permissions/Prime-Beacon checklist. Add the missing `PermissionContext` fields/invariants, enforce permission lock/expiry/task scope in `can_accept_work()`, align `heartbeat_stale()` with the reviewed `last_prompt_sent_at` seconds semantics or update the reviewed contract before implementation, and normalize `PrimeAutonomyInput` containers to immutable representations or defensive copies. Add focused regression tests for each repaired invariant. Preserve the no-live-process-control boundary and do not edit UI/Bifrost/FileMap/Polaris.

Tests:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_session_lifecycle.py -q`

Completion:

- Coordinator landed the scoped repair on current main as commit `e486de2d`.
- Files changed: `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py`, `tests/test_session_lifecycle.py`.
- Repairs applied: `PermissionContext` now carries secondary approval, unlock expiry, and task scope; work acceptance observes permission lock/expiry/scope; heartbeat staleness aligns to prompt-sent seconds semantics; Prime autonomy input containers are protected for deterministic/immutable use.
- Proof: `python -m pytest tests/test_session_lifecycle.py -q` passed.

Goal: repair Session Lifecycle permissions and Prime/Beacon binding review visibility.

Review finding routed by Codex Reviews A on 2026-06-01 18:08 -06:00:

- HIGH: review provenance/branch visibility — Build 2 implementation commit `6e2f2a5f` was not on `origin/main` (only on `worktree-build-2-session-lifecycle`), blocking Codex Reviews A from running proof tests.

Task: land the Session Lifecycle permissions and Prime/Beacon binding implementation on current main.

Review finding routed by Codex Reviews A on 2026-06-01 16:28 -06:00:

- HIGH: `SessionAction` currently represents reuse/start/summarize/transfer/avoid, but not the required Relay-selected `archive` or `request_human_gate` actions (`meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py:87`).
- MEDIUM: `SessionActionReason.CONTEXT_FILL`, `REVIEW_GATE`, and `PERMISSION_BOUNDARY` are typed but not exercised by `suggest_routing_action()` or tests; current routing tests cover context healthy, payload budget, stale heartbeat, reasoning shift, project scope, and transfer only (`meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py:199`, `tests/test_session_lifecycle.py:78`).

Task: completed the typed Session Lifecycle model so Prime can represent Relay session actions without live process control: reuse existing session, start new session, summarize and reset, transfer/handoff, archive, and request human gate. Context-fill, reasoning-shift, project-scope, stale-heartbeat, review-gate, and permission-boundary reasons are represented and covered by tests. Unique-worktree, assigned-queue, and branch-permission invariants remain preserved. No processes, branch movement, model calls, UI edits, or Polaris changes were added.

Tests:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_session_lifecycle.py -q`

Completion: landed on current `origin/main` in commit `558af555` (`feat: complete Session Lifecycle routing-action coverage`). Files changed: `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py`, `tests/test_session_lifecycle.py`. Proof: `python -m pytest tests/test_session_lifecycle.py -q` passed with 24 tests on 2026-06-01.

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py`, `tests/test_session_lifecycle.py`, `docs/live-build-2.md`.

Required sources: `docs/session-lifecycle-v2-contract.md`, `docs/relay-heartbeat-model-routing-logic.md`, `docs/relay-completeness-audit.md`, and the review clearance in `docs/live-codex-reviews.md`.

Task: add focused tests proving Prime-facing command-plan behavior can consume the repaired Session Lifecycle routing actions and reasons. Cover archive, request-human-gate, summarize/reset, transfer, context-fill, review-gate, and permission-boundary routing signals through existing typed helpers only. Keep this pure runtime/test coverage; do not spawn sessions, call models, inspect processes, edit UI, move branches, or touch Polaris.

Tests:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_session_lifecycle.py -q`

Completion: Build 2 completed Prime command-plan tests consuming new routing actions/reasons; worker commit `f69d6683` was not on current `origin/main`, so the coordinator landed the same scoped test slice on main as commit `17d70c9d`; files changed: tests/test_session_lifecycle.py (added 12 focused tests covering ARCHIVE/REQUEST_HUMAN_GATE/SUMMARIZE_RESET/TRANSFER commands and CONTEXT_FILL/REVIEW_GATE/PERMISSION_BOUNDARY routing signals, proving Prime-facing command-plan behavior); tests 34 passed (22 prior + 12 new Prime command-plan tests exercising archive, human-gate, transfer, and summarize-reset routing decisions); Obsidian: not required (code-only); cadence 2 of 3; Ready for Codex Review.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: implement Session Lifecycle permissions and Prime/Beacon binding now that command-plan routing coverage cleared review.

Worktree: `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\build-2-session-lifecycle`.

Task: implement the typed permissions and Prime/Beacon binding slice without live process control. Add or extend frozen data structures/helpers so Session Lifecycle can represent branch/worktree permission state, Prime routing recommendations, Beacon heartbeat/staleness observations, and decision reasons needed by Relay/Prime. Preserve existing command-plan behavior and unique-worktree/assigned-queue invariants.

Completion:

  - Dataclasses: PermissionContext (approval/escalation), RestartResteerFinding (Beacon findings), PrimeAutonomyInput (Prime selection input)
  - SessionLifecycleState updated: permission_context now typed as PermissionContext; added helper methods is_permission_locked(), requires_approval_for_operation(), can_execute_operation()
  - All fields frozen and immutable
- Tests: `python -m pytest tests/test_session_lifecycle.py -q` — 52 tests passed (47 prior routing/command tests + 5 new permission/finding/prime-input tests)
- Ready for Codex Review.

## Next Candidate Task

Goal: add Session Lifecycle restart/resteer recovery tests after permissions binding clears review.

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py`, `tests/test_session_lifecycle.py`, `docs/live-build-2.md`.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: repair the Session Lifecycle implementation checklist provenance before runtime implementation proceeds.

Status: **Completed** in commit `7d20f47`; Codex review cleared (no blocking findings).

- Restored `docs/session-lifecycle-implementation-checklist.md` (520 lines) from the reviewed Session Lifecycle contract.
- Covers 6 type-safe enums, 2 frozen dataclasses with 10+ helpers, legality matrix (18 transitions + 11 command-state pairs), proof progression, executability gates, and invariants.
- Tests syntax-validated; 12/12 passing in test_session_lifecycle.py; no suspicious patterns.
- Cadence 3 of 3 complete; Codex review: pass, no blocking findings (commit db3fe72).
- Push: origin/main; Codex review cleared 2026-06-05 03:58.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: write the V2 Session Lifecycle contract so Prime can spawn, watch, steer, recover, and hand off sessions through typed state instead of ad hoc UI supervision.

Allowed files only: `docs/session-lifecycle-v2-contract.md`, `docs/live-build-2.md`.

Task: create `docs/session-lifecycle-v2-contract.md`.

Cover:

- `SessionLifecycleState` responsibilities: session id/name, project, harness role, assigned queue file, model/provider, status, worktree path, branch, current task id, last read/write heartbeat, last prompt payload size, review/cadence state, health, blocker summary, and permission context.
- `SessionCommandPlan` responsibilities: spawn, watch, poll_queue, steer, stop_request, transfer, archive, restart, resteer, recover_from_limit, and request_human_gate.
- Unique worktree invariant: every worker/review session must run in a separate worktree; branch movement requires Scott or Prime permission.
- Queue routing invariant: build sessions read only their assigned build queue, review sessions read only their assigned review queue.
- Workflow/sub-agent principle: harness work should run in bounded workflow contexts when available so Prime does not absorb every harness transcript.
- Proof and safety: command plans must include evidence refs, Aegis/cadence gate status, and whether the command is executable or human-gated.
- Out of scope: no live Polaris/Electron automation, no destructive commands, no branch switching, no vendor-account automation.

Tests: none required, docs-only.

Completion: coordinator completed this contract slice in `e37030e`.

Include enum/dataclass names, fields, legality helpers, executability helpers, proof expectations, tests to write, and what must remain out of runtime execution until later. Do not implement `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py` until the contract is reviewed.

Completion:

- Build 2 completed this checklist in `0296525`.
- Files changed: `docs/session-lifecycle-implementation-checklist.md`, `docs/live-build-2.md`.
- Tests: not required (docs-only).
- Routed to Codex Reviews A for docs/contract review.

Ready for Codex Review.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Ready For Codex Review

Goal: implement the Session Lifecycle domain objects from the reviewed contract/checklist.

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py`, `tests/test_session_lifecycle.py`, `docs/live-build-2.md`.

Task: create the first runtime slice for `SessionLifecycleState` and `SessionCommandPlan` from `docs/session-lifecycle-v2-contract.md` and `docs/session-lifecycle-implementation-checklist.md`. Model spawn, watch, poll_queue, steer, stop_request, transfer, archive, restart, resteer, recover_from_limit, and request_human_gate as typed actions without executing live process control. Include legality/executability helpers, proof refs, queue routing, unique-worktree and branch-permission constraints, and human-gate behavior. If Codex Reviews A routes a checklist finding before implementation is committed, repair that finding first.

Tests:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_session_lifecycle.py -q`

Completion:

- Build 2 completed Session Lifecycle runtime implementation in commit `910e652`.
- Files changed: `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py`, `tests/test_session_lifecycle.py`.
- Tests: `python -m pytest tests/test_session_lifecycle.py -q` — 12 passed.
- Push: complete (`910e652`).
- Ready for Codex Review.

## ~~Codex Repair Active Task - Reviews A Round 6~~

**Completed by coordinator in `39c9ac8`; awaiting Codex review.**

~~Goal: repair PrimeNextAction human-gate executability semantics.

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/prime_autonomy.py`, `tests/test_prime_autonomy.py`, `docs/live-build-2.md`.

Finding: Codex Reviews A found a MEDIUM behavior bug in commit `40def3d`. `PrimeNextAction.human_gate_required` is documented as "Must wait for human approval before executing", but `PrimeNextAction.is_executable()` returns `True` whenever there are no blockers, even when `human_gate_required` is `True`. That lets a high-risk action marked as human-gated appear executable before approval.

Task: make the executable predicate respect the human gate. The simplest acceptable repair is for `is_executable()` to return `False` when `human_gate_required` is `True` or blockers are present. Update the existing tests that currently expect human-gated actions to be executable, and add/keep focused coverage proving high-risk human-gated actions are not executable until a later approval model exists. Do not add live execution, UI, package exports, or approval workflows in this repair.

Tests: `python -m pytest tests/test_prime_autonomy.py -q`

Completion: commit only the allowed repair files, push, update Obsidian, and mark Ready for Codex Review with commit hash, files changed, tests run, and Obsidian status.~~

**Coordinator note:** Codex patched this repair directly in main while Claude lanes were capacity-blocked. `PrimeNextAction.is_executable()` now returns false when a human gate is pending, and `tests/test_prime_autonomy.py` was updated to prove high-risk human-gated actions are not executable. Proof: `python -m pytest tests/test_prime_autonomy.py -q` passed with 30 tests. This coordinator repair must be routed to Codex review after commit.

## Archived Prior Active Task - Do Not Execute

Goal: write the V2 Bifrost integration contract for Prime next action and prompt payload telemetry.

Allowed files only: `docs/bifrost-v2-prime-relay-integration-contract.md`, `docs/live-build-2.md`.

Task: create a concise implementation contract for wiring the new V2 domain slices into Bifrost without putting decision logic inside the UI.

Cover:

- How Bifrost should display `PrimeNextAction` from `meridian_core/prime_autonomy.py`.
- How Bifrost should display `PromptPayloadSnapshot` from `meridian_core/prompt_payload_meter.py`.
- Which fields belong in the cockpit snapshot/view model.
- Which fields are status/proof only and must not become UI-owned decision logic.
- How Aegis/Relay warnings should surface when prompt payload growth is degraded.
- What remains out of scope until the runtime integration slice.

Tests: none required, docs-only.

Completion: commit only this Bifrost integration contract slice, push, update Obsidian, and mark Ready for Codex Review with commit hash, files changed, and tests run.

## Next Candidate Task

Goal: extend Session Lifecycle permissions and Prime/Beacon binding after the first runtime object slice clears review.

Allowed files only: `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py`, `tests/test_session_lifecycle.py`, `docs/live-build-2.md`.

Task: create the first runtime slice for `SessionLifecycleState` and `SessionCommandPlan` from `docs/session-lifecycle-v2-contract.md` and `docs/session-lifecycle-implementation-checklist.md`. Model spawn, watch, poll_queue, steer, stop_request, transfer, archive, restart, resteer, recover_from_limit, and request_human_gate as typed actions without executing live process control. Include legality/executability helpers, proof refs, queue routing, unique-worktree and branch-permission constraints, and human-gate behavior.

Tests:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_session_lifecycle.py -q`

## Superseded Task

Goal: write the V2 harness maturity/build-number policy.

Allowed files only: `docs/harness-maturity-build-policy.md`, `docs/live-build-2.md`.

Task: create `docs/harness-maturity-build-policy.md`. Define how Meridian tracks overall build number, per-harness build number, maturity level, review status, and whether a harness is contract-only, runtime-ready, UI-visible, or production-ready. Include Prime, Bifrost, Relay, Aegis, Beacon, Echo, Atlas, and Workflow. This supersedes any stale lower package/API task.

Tests: none required, docs-only.

Completion: commit only this maturity policy slice, push, update Obsidian, and mark Ready for Codex Review.

## Archived Prior Active Task - Do Not Execute

Goal: write the V2 package/API surface policy for Echo, Atlas, and Prime Autonomy.

Allowed files only: `docs/package-api-surface-note.md`, `docs/v2-package-api-surface-note.md`, `docs/live-build-2.md`.

Task: create `docs/v2-package-api-surface-note.md` defining which V2 harness objects should eventually be public package exports and which should stay internal. Cover Echo (`MemoryRecord`, `MemoryQuery`, `MemoryHit`), Atlas (`AtlasQuery`, `AtlasHit`, `AtlasResult`), Prime Autonomy (`PrimeNextAction`), Session Lifecycle, and Workflow dispatch. Update `docs/package-api-surface-note.md` with a short pointer to the V2 note. Do not edit runtime code, package exports, FileMap, or tests.

Tests: none required, docs-only.

Completion: commit only this package/API policy slice, push, update Obsidian, and mark Ready for Codex Review.

This file is the standing assignment queue for Build 2.

When idle, check this file every 10 minutes. If there is an active task below, execute it. If the task is complete, commit and push your slice, update Obsidian, then report completion in your session and return to polling this file.

Rules:

- This session must behave as a live worker, not a one-shot handoff. After completing a task, return to this file and keep polling every 10 minutes.
- Before editing any task file, verify you are in your own unique worktree. If you are in `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian` main worktree or sharing a worktree with another lane, stop and report the worktree violation instead of editing.
- If there is no Active Task, do not stop. Append a Read Checks entry, wait 10 minutes, pull latest, and check again.
- Always pull latest `origin/main` before editing.
- Every time you check/read this file, add a timestamped entry to the Read Checks section.
- Every time you modify this file or complete a task from it, add a timestamped entry to the Write/Completion Log section.
- Every minute while idle, check for cross-check activity relevant to your slice: review notes, Codex findings, Aegis findings, failing tests, or Obsidian build log updates.
- If cross-check activity affects your task, record it in this file's Cross-Check Activity section and address it before starting unrelated work.
- After completing a task, mark the slice `Ready for Codex Review` with commit hash, files changed, and tests run.
- Do not perform your own Codex review. A separate Codex Reviews lane owns independent review, findings, and repair routing.
- If the Codex Reviews lane writes a repair task into this file, complete that repair before taking unrelated work.
- After every three completed task-changing commits, pause normal build work until the Codex Reviews lane records a cadence review result.
- Use local time with timezone when possible.
- Own only the files listed in the active task.
- Do not edit Build 1 or Build 3 live queue files.
- Do not edit files owned by another active build task.
- Keep scope tight.
- Run the requested tests.
- Commit only your slice.
- Push to `origin/main`.
- Update Obsidian build notes in `G:\My Drive\Aesop Academy\Obsidian\Meridian_Build`.
- Mark completed slices `Ready for Codex Review` in this file. Include commit hash, files changed, and tests run so `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` can clear or route repairs.

## Archived Prior Active Task - Do Not Execute

Archived Task - Coordinator Override:

Goal: create the V2 progress tracker so V2 becomes countable in progress reports.

Context:

- V0 and V1 are complete.
- `docs/v2-detailed-build-plan.md` exists and defines the V2 tracks.
- Scott wants progress reports to show total items built, total left, and percentages.
- Every tracker item must be framed as Prime or harness ownership. No loose feature names.
- This is a Haiku-safe docs/accounting slice. Do not implement runtime code.

Allowed files only:

- `docs/v2-progress-tracker.md`
- `docs/v0-v1-progress-tracker.md`
- `docs/live-build-2.md`

Task:

- Create `docs/v2-progress-tracker.md`.
- Convert the V2 detailed plan into countable checklist items grouped by owner: Prime Autonomy, Echo Harness, Atlas Harness, Relay/Model Harness, Aegis Harness, Session Lifecycle Harness, Bifrost Harness, FileMap Harness, and Review/Codex Harness.
- Include totals table with Built / In Progress / Needs Build / Total / Percent.
- Mark already-built V2 items accurately: CognitionPolicy domain model, policy-aware Relay executor wrapper, Echo/Atlas contract docs, and workflow sub-agent architecture principle if represented as an architecture/contract baseline.
- Mark first-wave tasks still needed, including Echo runtime, Atlas runtime, PrimeNextAction, SessionLifecycleState, Bifrost V2 extensions, and FileMap follow-ups.
- Update `docs/v0-v1-progress-tracker.md` to point V2 reporting at the new tracker.
- Do not edit runtime code or FileMap.

Tests:

- No tests required. Docs-only.

Completion:

- Commit only this tracker slice.
- Push to `origin/main`.
- Update Obsidian in `G:\My Drive\Aesop Academy\Obsidian\Meridian_Build`.
- Mark this slice `Ready for Codex Review` with commit hash, files changed, and tests run.

Stale prior task follows.

Coordinator Override - Archived Task (supersedes stale CognitionPolicy export task below):

Goal: write the Bifrost Electron/preview package surface policy note.

Context:

- Build 5 owns the actual Electron app shell and `bifrost/preview.py` implementation.
- Build 2 owns package/API surface decisions and should keep public imports intentional.
- The existing Bifrost package already exports renderer/view-model names from `bifrost/__init__.py`.
- The new Electron shell will introduce preview-generation and app-entry concepts; these should not automatically become `meridian_core` root exports.
- This is a Haiku-sized docs/API policy slice. Do not implement the Electron app.

Allowed files only:

- `docs/package-api-surface-note.md`
- `docs/bifrost-preview-package-api-note.md`
- `docs/live-build-2.md`

Task:

- Create `docs/bifrost-preview-package-api-note.md`.
- Explain the intended public surface for Bifrost preview/app entrypoints:
  - Bifrost package imports should stay under `bifrost`, not `meridian_core`.
  - `render_cockpit_html`, `sample_cockpit_view_model`, and future preview helpers are Bifrost UI harness surface.
  - Electron app commands belong to `package.json` / app shell, not Python package-root exports.
  - Preview generation should expose a small stable helper only after Build 5 lands it.
  - Avoid exporting file-writing helpers from `meridian_core.__all__`.
- Update `docs/package-api-surface-note.md` with a short Bifrost section that points to the new note.
- Do not edit `bifrost/`, `package.json`, `electron/`, `meridian_core/__init__.py`, FileMap, or other queues.

Tests:

- No tests required. Docs-only.
- Optional sanity check: `python -m pytest tests/test_package_api.py -q` if you touch package API wording that references current exports.

Completion:

- Commit only this docs/API policy slice.
- Push to `origin/main`.
- Update Obsidian in `G:\My Drive\Aesop Academy\Obsidian\Meridian_Build`.
- Mark this slice `Ready for Codex Review` with commit hash, files changed, and tests run.
- Return to polling `docs/live-build-2.md` every 30 seconds.

Stale prior task follows.

Archived Task:

Goal: expose the V2 CognitionPolicy API through the package root.

Context:

- V2 is active.
- Build 1 completed `meridian_core/cognition_policy.py` in commit `3cdc74d`.
- Coordinator review found the domain model clean: 102 Aegis+cognition_policy tests passed.
- Build 2 owns package/API surface work.
- Downstream Prime/Relay code should be able to import the stable cognition policy domain from `meridian_core`, not only from the submodule.
- This is a small Haiku-safe package export slice.

Allowed files only:

- `meridian_core/__init__.py`
- `tests/test_package_api.py`
- `docs/live-build-2.md`

Task:

- Import the public cognition policy names from `.cognition_policy` in `meridian_core/__init__.py`.
- Add them to `__all__`.
- Add a focused package API smoke test in `tests/test_package_api.py`.
- Export only intentional public names. Do not export private helpers or implementation constants.
- Do not edit `meridian_core/cognition_policy.py` unless a package-export test reveals an unavoidable issue; if that happens, stop and report instead of broadening scope.
- Do not edit FileMap; Build 3 owns FileMap.
- Do not edit Relay executor files; Build 1 owns runtime wiring.

Public names to export:

- `CognitionActionType`
- `CognitionLane`
- `CognitionDecision`
- `CognitionPolicy`
- `CognitionPolicyResult`
- `cognition_policy_for_tier`
- `evaluate_cognition_policy`

Tests:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_package_api.py -q`
- `python -m pytest tests/test_cognition_policy.py tests/test_package_api.py -q`
- Run the full suite only if the package export touches shared imports in a risky way.

Completion:

- Commit only this package API slice.
- Push to `origin/main`.
- Update Obsidian in `G:\My Drive\Aesop Academy\Obsidian\Meridian_Build`.
- Mark this slice `Ready for Codex Review` with commit hash, files changed, and tests run.

2026-06-01 18:25 -06:00 - Build 2 completed enforce remaining Session Lifecycle permission-invariant gaps (Codex Reviews A repair); commit e41851ae; files changed: meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py (added __post_init__ validation to PermissionContext for UNLOCKED_TEMPORARY/UNLOCKED_PERMANENT invariants; updated can_accept_work() to check task_scope; fixed can_execute_operation() to delegate to PermissionContext.can_execute_operation()), tests/test_session_lifecycle.py (fixed 4 fixtures to use valid permission states; added 8 new focused regression tests for invariant enforcement); tests: 60 passed (52 prior + 8 new permission invariant tests); push: origin/main successful (merged with concurrent updates); cadence count: 1 of 3; Ready for Codex Review

Last completed: V1 cockpit_provider package API surface; commit `14315b3`; files: meridian_core/__init__.py, tests/test_package_api.py; tests 1036 passed. Cadence count: 3 of 3 since cadence clear at `9c3e1a3`; review/cadence clearance may be needed before broad package API work, but this small V2 export is explicitly coordinator-assigned.

Anomaly note: the `prime_approve` code was committed by Build 3 and Build 4 sessions within their idle read check bundles rather than by a dedicated Build 2 completion commit. The implementation and tests are correct and verified. Flagged for orchestrator awareness.

Anomaly note 2: the cockpit_state package API surface (meridian_core/__init__.py + tests/test_package_api.py) was also committed by Build 4 and Build 3 respectively before Build 2 could execute the task. The implementation is correct and complete (all 11 public cockpit-state names exported, 992 tests pass). Flagged for orchestrator awareness.
