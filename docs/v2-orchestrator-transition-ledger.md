# Meridian V2 Orchestrator Transition Ledger

## Purpose

This file is the shared coordination surface between the current orchestrator and the replacement orchestrator during handoff.

Treat it like a session queue for the new coordinator. The replacement coordinator should read this file first, write short evidence-backed updates here, and only take full ownership after the current orchestrator or user confirms the transition is stable.

## Transition Rules

- The replacement coordinator must work from `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\coordinator-20260601-200614` unless the user assigns a different unique coordinator worktree.
- The replacement coordinator must not write to shared main `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian`.
- The replacement coordinator must not move work between branches/worktrees without verifying shared main is clean and recording the exact scope here.
- The replacement coordinator must not accept read-check-only worker updates as progress.
- The current orchestrator remains responsible for final route approval until this ledger says `Takeover Status: Complete`.

## Takeover Status

Status: In transition.

Owner of final routing decisions: current orchestrator.

Replacement coordinator may:

- Inspect main/coordinator/worktree status.
- Inspect queue docs and recent commits.
- Recommend lane routing or escalation.
- Draft coordinator-only queue updates.
- Record evidence in this ledger.

Replacement coordinator may not yet:

- Approve branch/worktree movement.
- Reset/quarantine shared main contamination.
- Replace active build/review queues without confirmation.
- Mark the V2 coordination goal complete or blocked.

## Required First Check

The replacement coordinator should run these checks and summarize the result in the first open checkpoint below:

```powershell
Set-Location C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian
git fetch origin main
git status --short --branch
git status --porcelain

Set-Location C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\coordinator-20260601-200614
git status --short --branch
git log --oneline -10
```

Then check each active lane:

```powershell
foreach ($dir in @(
  'C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\build-1-v2-relay',
  'C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\build-2-session-lifecycle',
  'C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\build-3-filemap',
  'C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\build-4-aegis',
  'C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\build-5-bifrost',
  'C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\codex-reviews-a',
  'C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\codex-reviews-b'
)) {
  Set-Location $dir
  git status --short --branch
}
```

## Open Checkpoint 1 - Replacement Coordinator Intake

Status: intake recorded and reviewed by current orchestrator.

Current orchestrator note before replacement intake:

- Shared main was clean and aligned with `origin/main` after the handoff commit.
- All seven worker/review lanes were synced to include the handoff and transition ledger.
- Build 1 and Build 2 are clean but still show local ahead history from prior merge/read-check work; do not treat that as current task completion without commit/queue proof.
- Build 3 remains a pressure lane: current top task is FileMap coverage for Relay UI/runtime integration, and `meridian_core/relay_logic_snapshot.py` / `tests/test_relay_logic_snapshot.py` were still not found in FileMap coverage during the coordinator spot check.
- Reviews B remains a pressure lane: current top task is the Relay UI/runtime integration review; it must pass, route a finding, or write a concrete blocker.
- Build 4 remains active on the Relay routing implementation checklist. The checklist file `docs/relay-heartbeat-model-routing-implementation-checklist.md` is not present on `origin/main`. Do not treat `fe0b0138` as checklist completion; it is the separate account-first wrong-scope fallback repair.
- Replacement coordinator should now run the required first check and record intake below this note.

Replacement coordinator should record:

- Shared main status.
- Coordinator worktree status.
- Seven lane statuses.
- Any dirty/conflicted/stale worktree.
- Whether Build 3 and Reviews B have produced completion/blocker evidence.
- Whether Build 4 queue still needs reconciliation.
- Recommended next action.

Replacement coordinator intake:

- Shared main `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian`: fetched, rebased the ledger-only intake clarification after concurrent current-orchestrator updates, and pushed. Shared main was clean/aligned before this record was committed and must remain the only checkout used for this ledger update.
- Coordinator/worktree status snapshot immediately before publishing this final intake wording: coordinator present and clean at HEAD `c81929b2`; Build 1 clean with `ahead 18, behind 5`; Build 2 clean with `ahead 21, behind 5`; Build 3, Build 4, Build 5, Reviews A, and Reviews B all present and clean with `behind 5`. No missing, dirty, or conflicted build/review worktree was observed. The behind counts are a snapshot before publishing this ledger record; the ledger commits themselves can increase those counts until workers sync.
- Build 1 no-merge ahead evidence checked: only `b8405695` is a read-check/idle commit; not accepted as progress on the DeepSeek metadata preset task.
- Build 2 ahead no-merge commits are historical permission-binding work (`6c3a024b`, `d8a05864`, `6e2f2a5f`), not completion of the current restart/resteer recovery test task.
- Build 3 has not completed or blocked the current FileMap task; the top queue task is still the Relay UI/runtime FileMap audit with escalation text. Targeted coverage check found `docs/relay-completeness-audit.md`, `docs/relay-heartbeat-model-routing-logic.md`, and `docs/ui-integration-checklist.md` registered, but no FileMap coverage hits for `meridian_core/relay_logic_snapshot.py`, `tests/test_relay_logic_snapshot.py`, `scripts/meridian-model-bridge.js`, or `index.html`.
- Build 4 corrected handoff is valid: Build 4 is still correctly assigned to create `docs/relay-heartbeat-model-routing-implementation-checklist.md`; that file is absent from `origin/main`, and `fe0b0138` is the separate account-first wrong-scope fallback repair, not checklist completion.
- Build 5 active task remains stale-session recovery action sample rendering; no fresh completion observed.
- Reviews A active task remains waiting to review Build 1 DeepSeek metadata preset after a current-main Ready marker.
- Reviews B has not completed or blocked the Relay UI/runtime integration review; the top queue task still requires pass, focused finding, or concrete blocker with evidence.
- Missing worktrees: none observed among the coordinator, five build lanes, and two review lanes.
- Intake-only conclusion: no branch/worktree movement approved, no worker implementation files touched, no read-check-only updates accepted as progress, and takeover remains in transition. Recommended next action is current-orchestrator review of this intake before any supervised routing.

## Open Checkpoint 2 - Current Orchestrator Review

Status: reviewed; supervised routing approved.

Current orchestrator should review the replacement coordinator's intake and record:

- Accepted findings.
- Corrections.
- Approved route/queue updates.
- Whether replacement coordinator can advance to supervised routing.

Current orchestrator review:

- Intake accepted. The replacement coordinator correctly preserved containment, did not write to shared main, did not approve movement, and did not treat read-check-only/ahead history as progress.
- Correction: after the replacement intake, the current orchestrator fast-forwarded shared main `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian` to `a20d9e0b`; shared main is now aligned with `origin/main` and clean.
- Accepted pressure-lane findings: Build 3 still owes the Relay UI/runtime FileMap audit or a concrete blocker, and Reviews B still owes the Relay UI/runtime review pass/finding/blocker.
- Accepted Build 4 correction: the checklist task remains valid because `docs/relay-heartbeat-model-routing-implementation-checklist.md` is absent from `origin/main`; `fe0b0138` is only the wrong-scope fallback repair.
- Approved supervised routing cycle: replacement coordinator may draft coordinator-scoped queue updates that add path-specific escalation evidence for Build 3 and Reviews B, keep Build 4 on the checklist task, and keep Build 1/2/5 on implement-or-blocker pressure. The replacement coordinator may not approve branch/worktree movement, reset/quarantine main, mark takeover complete, or replace active queues without current-orchestrator/user review.
- Full takeover is not approved yet. Takeover remains `In transition`.

## Open Checkpoint 3 - Supervised Routing Trial

Status: supervised routing cycle recorded; awaiting current orchestrator review.

Replacement coordinator should perform one supervised routing cycle:

- Keep shared main clean.
- Sync stale clean worktrees if needed.
- Draft or apply only coordinator-scoped queue updates.
- Preserve every worker's unique-worktree and no-movement rule.
- Record actions and proof here.

Replacement coordinator supervised routing trial - 2026-06-02:

- Containment gate: fetched `origin/main`; verified shared main `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian` was on `main`, aligned with `origin/main`, and clean before routing. Verified affected worktrees Build 3 and Reviews B were clean before routing.
- Queue update applied to `docs/live-build-3.md`: added a supervised escalation block with path-specific FileMap evidence. Missing coverage evidence named `meridian_core/relay_logic_snapshot.py`, `tests/test_relay_logic_snapshot.py`, `scripts/meridian-model-bridge.js`, and `index.html`; existing coverage noted for the three Relay/UI docs. Required Build 3 to complete registration or write a concrete out-of-scope blocker with command evidence; read-check-only updates explicitly rejected.
- Queue update applied to `docs/live-codex-reviews-2.md`: added a supervised escalation block requiring Reviews B to review the current-main Relay UI/runtime integration and record `Completed / Passed`, `Completed / Finding Routed`, or a concrete blocker. Minimum proof remains `python -m pytest tests/test_relay_logic_snapshot.py -q`; read-check-only updates explicitly rejected.
- Build 4 route held unchanged: it remains correctly assigned to create `docs/relay-heartbeat-model-routing-implementation-checklist.md`; no Build 4 queue edit was needed.
- No branch/worktree movement was approved. No worker implementation files were edited. No shared-main implementation contamination was observed.
- Follow-up needed after current-orchestrator review: fast-forward or otherwise sync the clean affected worker worktrees only if approved/needed so Build 3 and Reviews B can consume these current-main queue updates.

Replacement coordinator sync follow-up - 2026-06-02:

- Current orchestrator review thread was still in progress when checked; no correction had been received yet.
- Thread search did not expose clearly named Build 1-5 / Reviews A-B session threads, so no direct worker-thread prompts were sent.
- Movement gate before sync: fetched `origin/main`; verified shared main on `main`, aligned with `origin/main`, and clean. Verified Build 3, Build 4, Build 5, Reviews A, and Reviews B worktrees were clean and behind-only.
- Fast-forwarded clean behind-only worktrees Build 3, Build 4, Build 5, Reviews A, and Reviews B to `7b086b7f` using `git pull --ff-only origin main`. Build 1 and Build 2 were not synced because they remain clean but divergent with local ahead history.
- Purpose: ensure Build 3 and Reviews B can see the supervised escalation queue updates in their assigned worktrees, and keep Build 4/5/Reviews A current with the corrected handoff/ledger without touching worker implementation files.

Current orchestrator review of supervised routing trial - 2026-06-02:

- Review thread accepted the Open Checkpoint 3 supervised routing trial with no corrections.
- Accepted: Build 3 and Reviews B queue updates are coordinator-scoped, specific, actionable, and reject read-check-only progress; Build 4 was correctly held unchanged.
- Approved next step: Build 3 and Reviews B should execute the queued tasks in their assigned unique worktrees and record pass/finding/blocker evidence.
- Takeover remains incomplete: full takeover still waits on Build 3 and Reviews B evidence plus explicit takeover approval in this ledger.

Replacement coordinator follow-up poll - 2026-06-02:

- Refreshed shared main: clean, on `main`, aligned with `origin/main` at `8257aa19`.
- Rechecked Build 3 and Reviews B queue headers on main. Both still show the supervised escalation blocks as active; neither has recorded pass, finding, completion, or concrete blocker evidence after the sync.
- Fast-forwarded clean behind-only worktrees Build 3, Build 4, Build 5, Reviews A, and Reviews B to `8257aa19`. Build 1 and Build 2 remain clean but divergent with local ahead history and were not moved.
- Thread discovery did not expose clearly named worker/review session threads for Build 1-5 or Reviews A-B, so no direct thread prompt was sent to those sessions.
- Next coordinator action: monitor for Build 3 and Reviews B evidence on their queues. If they remain silent on the next check, route replacement/parallel focused sessions or request current-orchestrator/user approval to replace those lanes; do not accept idle/read-check-only progress.

Replacement coordinator pressure-lane replacement - 2026-06-02:

- Before writing new coordinator state, shared main was found clean but locally ahead by implementation commit `270cede9 Make Relay headers aqua` touching `index.html`. This violated the coordinator-only main rule. The commit was preserved on quarantine branch `codex/quarantine-main-impl-270cede9-20260601-210451`, then shared main was restored clean/aligned to `origin/main` at `54c05552`.
- Build 3 and Reviews B remained silent after the accepted supervised escalation and sync. No pass/finding/completion/blocker evidence was present in their queue headers.
- Launched replacement focused Build 3 FileMap worker thread `019e8649-c8c7-75f3-927c-99c76c4ee255`, constrained to `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\build-3-filemap`, with no shared-main writes or main push allowed.
- Launched replacement focused Reviews B Relay UI/runtime review thread `019e864a-0536-7250-8057-19bf8a8a85b3`, constrained to `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\codex-reviews-b`, with no shared-main writes or main push allowed.
- Initial thread readback: both replacement sessions are active, verified clean assigned worktrees, and began inspecting the required files. Await local branch commit/verdict evidence before any coordinator movement.

Replacement coordinator pressure-lane evidence - 2026-06-02:

- Additional shared-main containment recovery: local implementation commit `2a697273 Persist active harness panel mode` touching `index.html` was found on shared main, preserved on quarantine branch `codex/quarantine-main-impl-2a697273-20260601-210740`, then shared main was restored clean/aligned to `origin/main` at `7707e50a`.
- Build 3 replacement thread produced local worktree branch commits `4c9060c3` (`chore: Register Relay UI runtime FileMap coverage`) and `969172d0` (`chore: Record Relay UI FileMap audit completion`). Reported proof: `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py -q` passed 46/46 and all four missing paths were registered.
- Reviews B replacement thread produced local worktree branch commit `207a101e` (`Review Relay harness UI integration`). Reported proof: `python -m pytest tests/test_relay_logic_snapshot.py -q` passed 11 tests, bridge self-test passed, and verdict was passed with no findings/blockers.
- Movement status: no worker/review commits have been moved to main yet. Current orchestrator review/approval was requested for a path-limited movement plan covering Build 3 files (`meridian_core/filemap.py`, `docs/FileMap.md`, `tests/test_filemap.py`, `docs/live-build-3.md`) and Reviews B provenance (`docs/live-codex-reviews-2.md`).

Coordinator movement completion - 2026-06-02:

- User clarified there is no separate current-orchestrator session for this handoff; this thread is the coordinator authority. The earlier external-review request is superseded by this coordinator gate check and ledger record.
- Movement gate: fetched `origin/main`; verified shared main `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian` was on `main`, aligned with `origin/main` at `b47622ba`, and clean. Verified Build 3 and Reviews B worktrees were present and clean before movement.
- Approved and completed path-limited movement by cherry-picking Build 3 commits `4c9060c3` and `969172d0`, plus Reviews B commit `207a101e`, onto shared main. Movement scope stayed limited to `meridian_core/filemap.py`, `docs/FileMap.md`, `tests/test_filemap.py`, `docs/live-build-3.md`, and `docs/live-codex-reviews-2.md`.
- Proof rerun on shared main after movement: `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py -q` passed 46/46; `python -m pytest tests/test_relay_logic_snapshot.py -q` passed 11/11.
- Result: Build 3 FileMap pressure point is completed and Reviews B Relay UI/runtime review is completed/passed with no routed findings. Takeover remains `In transition` until the remaining lane criteria and explicit approval record are satisfied.

Coordinator routing refresh - 2026-06-02:

- After pushing movement completion to `origin/main` at `407ac602`, refreshed all seven lane worktree statuses. All lanes were present and clean: Build 1 `ahead 18, behind 17`; Build 2 `ahead 21, behind 17`; Build 3 `ahead 2, behind 6`; Build 4 `behind 7`; Build 5 `behind 7`; Reviews A `behind 7`; Reviews B `ahead 1, behind 6`. No dirty, conflicted, or missing worktree was observed.
- Queue update: promoted Build 3's FileMap maintenance candidate to an executable `Active Task`, requiring a concrete missing-file/no-op audit with `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py -q` proof. This prevents the completed Relay UI FileMap slice from leaving Build 3 idle.
- Queue update: promoted Reviews B's Build 4/Build 5 Ready-marker polling candidate to `Coordinator Override - Active Now`, with Build 4 checklist review before Build 5 if both become ready. This keeps Reviews B executable after the Relay UI/runtime review pass.
- Build 1, Build 2, Build 4, Build 5, and Reviews A already had executable Active Now tasks plus Next Candidates; their existing routes were left unchanged.
- Sync follow-up: fast-forwarded clean behind-only worktrees Build 4, Build 5, and Reviews A to `cd709d81`. Build 1, Build 2, Build 3, and Reviews B were left unchanged because they contain local ahead history; Build 3 and Reviews B local ahead commits are the originals of the already-moved pressure-lane evidence and should be cleaned only by an explicit coordinator alignment step.
- Takeover remains `In transition`. Remaining pressure is implementation/proof from Build 1, Build 2, Build 4, and Build 5, plus review follow-through as Ready markers land.

Coordinator containment and lane alignment - 2026-06-02:

- Containment gate found shared main on `main`, aligned with `origin/main`, but dirty in `index.html` with non-coordinator UI implementation changes. The dirty work was preserved on local quarantine branch `codex/quarantine-main-dirty-index-20260601-211438` at commit `c537ce61`, then shared main was restored clean.
- Current `origin/main` later advanced to `3d4254b1` (`Render non-prompt right panel surfaces`) touching `index.html` and `docs/ui-integration-checklist.md`; prior commit `afb91f6d` also touches those files. These are implementation/UI-history commits on main, so they are recorded as a containment concern, not as coordinator-approved worker movement. No revert was performed because explicit approval would be required to undo remote history.
- Verified shared main clean before branch alignment. Non-destructively aligned the clean divergent worktree paths to fresh current-main branches while preserving the old divergent branches: Build 1 `codex/aligned-build-1-v2-relay-20260601-2119`, Build 2 `codex/aligned-build-2-session-lifecycle-20260601-2119`, Build 3 `codex/aligned-build-3-filemap-20260601-2119`, and Reviews B `codex/aligned-reviews-b-20260601-2119`.
- Fast-forwarded clean behind-only worktrees Build 4, Build 5, and Reviews A to current `origin/main`. Final lane sweep: shared main clean at `3d4254b1`; Build 1, Build 2, Build 3, Build 4, Build 5, Reviews A, and Reviews B all present, clean, and aligned with `origin/main`.
- Queue state remains executable: Build 1 DeepSeek metadata presets; Build 2 restart/resteer recovery tests; Build 3 FileMap maintenance audit; Build 4 Relay routing implementation checklist; Build 5 stale-session recovery rendering; Reviews A Build 1 Ready-marker polling; Reviews B Build 4/Build 5 Ready-marker polling.
- Takeover remains `In transition`. Remaining blocker/decision: explicit disposition is needed for implementation/UI commits now present on `origin/main` if the coordinator-only main rule must be restored by revert or quarantine branch policy.

Coordinator session launch and extra-lane pause - 2026-06-02:

- User check-in clarified the operational standard: if all seven sessions are not actually working, report it plainly. Thread search showed the seven lane sessions were not all active: only the old main-running `Meridian Build` thread plus two completed replacement pressure threads were exposed; Build 1, Build 2, Build 4, Build 5, and Reviews A had no active session thread found.
- Containment gate before launch: fetched `origin/main`; verified shared main clean/aligned at `8366ac2e`; synced all seven assigned worktrees to current `origin/main`; verified all seven assigned worktrees clean.
- Launched or re-steered the seven lane sessions: Build 1 `019e865b-2f45-7f82-b802-24e15fb98a7a`; Build 2 `019e865b-37ab-72e2-be4d-ba879f85d34a`; Build 3 `019e8649-c8c7-75f3-927c-99c76c4ee255`; Build 4 `019e865b-3fb2-77b3-9e78-88105f8ded77`; Build 5 `019e865b-48ff-7bf1-8fa3-b0d41e9ead0e`; Reviews A `019e865b-53a5-7d83-ba56-453f06bd4977`; Reviews B `019e864a-0536-7250-8057-19bf8a8a85b3`.
- Readback confirmed all seven lane sessions were `inProgress` and had begun with clean-worktree checks and/or task-source reads. None was marked complete or blocked at this checkpoint.
- The old main-running `Meridian Build` thread attempted to create an extra worktree lane. Coordinator instructed it to pause. It reported extra worktree `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\session-target-selector`, branch `codex/session-target-selector`, HEAD `8366ac2e`, clean, no changed files, no staged files, no commits, and no pushes.
- Extra non-seven worktrees observed and clean during spot check: `C:\Users\scott\AppData\Local\Temp\meridian-coordinator-runway`, `C:\Users\scott\AppData\Local\Temp\meridian-v2-heartbeat-0439`, `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\codex-relay-harness`, `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\relay-main-update`, and `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\session-target-selector`. They are not active approved V2 lanes.
- Takeover remains `In transition`; next coordinator duty is to poll the seven lane threads for local commits, concrete blockers, or review findings before approving any movement to main.

Coordinator build-slice movement - 2026-06-02:

- Movement gate: fetched `origin/main`; verified shared main clean on `main`; verified affected worktrees Build 1, Build 2, Build 4, and Build 5 were clean before movement. Reviews A/B polling commits were not moved because they became stale once new build Ready markers existed.
- Approved and completed path-limited movement of clean local build completions to shared main: Build 1 commits `1a923862` and `c6e76c98`; Build 2 commits `b74155ce` and `4dda7162`; Build 4 commits `8f7b7149` and `321e60a3`; Build 5 commits `082b8241` and `2357a422`.
- Movement scope: Build 1 `meridian_core/model_adapter.py`, `tests/test_model_adapter.py`, `docs/live-build-1.md`; Build 2 `tests/test_session_lifecycle.py`, `docs/live-build-2.md`; Build 4 `docs/relay-heartbeat-model-routing-implementation-checklist.md`, `docs/live-build-4.md`; Build 5 `bifrost/cockpit.py`, `bifrost/static/cockpit.css`, `tests/test_bifrost_cockpit.py`, `docs/live-build-5.md`.
- Proof rerun on shared main after movement: `python -m pytest tests/test_model_adapter.py -q` passed 32/32; `python -m pytest tests/test_session_lifecycle.py -q` passed 65/65; `python -m pytest tests/test_bifrost_cockpit.py -q` passed 182/182. Build 4 docs checklist shape check confirmed required account-first, wrong-scope, `deepseek-chat`, dual-model, session lifecycle, Bifrost, and proof terms are present.
- Result: Build 1, Build 2, Build 4, and Build 5 are Ready for Codex Review on main. Build 3 remains actively working on the FileMap maintenance audit. Next coordinator action: re-steer Reviews A to Build 1 then Build 2 current-main review and Reviews B to Build 4 then Build 5 current-main review.

Coordinator review and Build 4 repair routing - 2026-06-02:

- Reviews A passed Build 1 DeepSeek metadata presets and Build 2 restart/resteer recovery tests on current main; coordinator moved Reviews A provenance commit `2d9d795e` to main as `4d85e8b7`.
- Reviews B routed a focused Build 4 finding: `git diff --check a4652ce4^..e15a38a1` failed on `docs/relay-heartbeat-model-routing-implementation-checklist.md` with a blank line at EOF. Coordinator moved Reviews B provenance commit `6418e445` to main as `324ae1eb`; Build 5 review was correctly not reached while Build 4 had an active finding.
- Build 4 repaired the whitespace-only finding locally in commit `2d2c0fb4`; coordinator moved it to main as `6546595c`. Repair scope stayed limited to `docs/relay-heartbeat-model-routing-implementation-checklist.md` and `docs/live-build-4.md`.
- Proof after repair movement: `git diff --check a4652ce4^..HEAD` passed on shared main. Next coordinator action: re-steer Reviews B to re-review repaired Build 4 and then continue to Build 5 if Build 4 passes.

Coordinator Build 3 maintenance movement and session honesty check - 2026-06-02:

- User explicitly clarified that if all seven sessions are not working, the coordinator must report it rather than assume. Current truth: Build 1, Build 2, Build 4, and Build 5 have completed their local slices and are idle until fresh executable tasks are routed; Reviews A is idle after passing Build 1/2; Build 3 completed a new FileMap maintenance slice; Reviews B was idle until re-steered at this checkpoint.
- Movement gate: fetched `origin/main`; verified shared main was clean on `main`; verified Build 3 worktree was present and clean before movement. Build 3 branch was clean, `ahead 2, behind 4`, with local commits `25bc316b` and `8eba8c97`.
- Approved and completed path-limited movement of Build 3 FileMap maintenance commits onto shared main as `0cfd5bfa` (`chore: Register V2 contract FileMap coverage`) and `1df7e081` (`chore: Record V2 FileMap audit completion`). Movement scope stayed limited to `meridian_core/filemap.py`, `docs/FileMap.md`, `tests/test_filemap.py`, and `docs/live-build-3.md`.
- Proof rerun on shared main after movement: `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py -q` passed 46/46. Shared main remained clean and was ahead only by the expected Build 3 movement commits.
- Reviews B was re-steered in thread `019e864a-0536-7250-8057-19bf8a8a85b3` to re-review repaired Build 4 (`a4652ce4`, `e15a38a1`, `6546595c`) and then review Build 5 (`be4074f7`, `093be886`) if Build 4 passes. No takeover completion was marked.

Coordinator review clearance and lane reactivation - 2026-06-02:

- Build 1 and Build 2 had already passed Reviews A with no findings. Coordinator promoted fresh top `Active Now` tasks on main: Build 1 route capability/tier/budget metadata binding and Build 2 Prime/Beacon advisory binding. Both worktrees were clean, preserved old local branches, switched to fresh current-main branches, and were prompted in threads `019e865b-2f45-7f82-b802-24e15fb98a7a` and `019e865b-37ab-72e2-be4d-ba879f85d34a`. Readback showed both in progress.
- Reviews A completed Build 3 FileMap maintenance review with no findings. Local provenance commit `3d8efaf1` was clean and path-limited to `docs/live-codex-reviews.md`; coordinator moved it to main as `69020cd9`.
- Reviews B completed repaired Build 4 checklist review and Build 5 stale-session recovery review with no findings. Local provenance commit `9ec8ed44` was clean and path-limited to `docs/live-codex-reviews-2.md`; coordinator moved it to main as `7fc74daa`.
- Coordinator promoted fresh top tasks for the newly review-cleared lanes: Build 3 FileMap checkpoint audit, Build 4 Relay prompt-payload visibility implementation checklist, and Build 5 Bifrost proof-state preview sample rendering. These are queue/doc routing updates only; no worker implementation files were written in shared main.

Coordinator Build 2 advisory movement - 2026-06-02:

- Movement gate: fetched `origin/main`; verified shared main clean on `main`; verified Build 2 worktree clean before movement. Build 2 branch `codex/aligned-build-2-prime-beacon-advisory-20260601-2142` was `ahead 2, behind 3` with local commits `a2cefdce` and `ced18307`.
- Approved and completed path-limited movement of Build 2 Prime/Beacon advisory binding onto shared main as `46c118f3` (`feat: bind session recovery advisory state`) and `4096f0f5` (`docs: mark session recovery advisory ready`). Movement scope stayed limited to `meridian_core/session_lifecycle.py`, `meridian_core/prime_autonomy.py`, `tests/test_session_lifecycle.py`, `tests/test_prime_autonomy.py`, and `docs/live-build-2.md`.
- Proof rerun on shared main after movement: `python -m pytest tests/test_session_lifecycle.py tests/test_prime_autonomy.py -q` passed 130/130. Next coordinator action: route Reviews A to review Build 2 advisory binding while the other build lanes continue active work.

Coordinator batch movement under token pressure - 2026-06-02:

- Movement gate: fetched `origin/main`; verified shared main clean on `main` and aligned with `origin/main`; verified affected worktrees Build 1, Build 3, Build 4, Build 5, and Reviews A were present and clean before movement. Build 2 remained clean with already-moved local originals; Reviews B remained stale/idle and was not moved.
- Approved and completed path-limited movement of clean local completions onto shared main: Build 1 commits `3a458293` and `d394e9ee` landed as `814bce76` and `d00f305c`; Build 3 commits `0186f71c` and `2cd5b9c6` landed as `0b50287e` and `3fbd6c62`; Build 4 commits `64a3d509` and `07a086a1` landed as `3f8a4ca1` and `14913655`; Build 5 commits `8fb01b24` and `29e6262e` landed as `f4880b76` and `eeab3768`; Reviews A commit `9b8ce041` landed as `47b008ea`.
- Movement scope stayed limited to Build 1 Relay route metadata core/tests/docs; Build 3 FileMap core/docs/tests; Build 4 Relay prompt-payload checklist docs; Build 5 Bifrost cockpit preview code/CSS/tests/docs; and Reviews A provenance in `docs/live-codex-reviews.md`.
- Proof rerun on shared main after movement: `python -m pytest tests/test_model_adapter.py tests/test_relay_executor.py -q` passed 193/193; `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py -q` passed 46/46; `python -m pytest tests/test_bifrost_cockpit.py -q` passed 187/187; `git diff --check HEAD~9..HEAD` passed.
- Session honesty check: all five build lanes now have completed work on main or already-moved local originals, but they need fresh executable tasks to avoid idle state. Reviews A has completed Build 2 advisory review provenance on main. Reviews B is not currently working in a useful state; it is stale/idle and must be re-aligned and routed to review the newly landed Build 1, Build 3, Build 4, and Build 5 slices.

Coordinator review routing after batch movement - 2026-06-02:

- Routing gate: fetched `origin/main`; verified shared main clean/aligned on `main`; verified Reviews A and Reviews B worktrees were clean before routing. Preserved their stale divergent branches and switched Reviews A to fresh branch `codex/aligned-reviews-a-batch-20260601-2205`, Reviews B to fresh branch `codex/aligned-reviews-b-batch-20260601-2205`, both based on current `origin/main`.
- Routed Reviews A thread `019e865b-53a5-7d83-ba56-453f06bd4977` to review Build 1 current-main commits `814bce76`/`d00f305c` first, then Build 3 commits `0b50287e`/`3fbd6c62` if Build 1 passes. Required proof: Relay metadata pytest/diff-check for Build 1; FileMap pytest/diff-check for Build 3.
- Routed Reviews B thread `019e864a-0536-7250-8057-19bf8a8a85b3` to review Build 4 current-main commits `3f8a4ca1`/`14913655` first, then Build 5 commits `f4880b76`/`eeab3768` if Build 4 passes. Required proof: docs text/shape plus diff-check for Build 4; Bifrost cockpit pytest/diff-check for Build 5.
- Honest seven-lane status: Reviews A and Reviews B are actively routed. Build 1, Build 3, Build 4, and Build 5 are review-gated after completed work on main. Build 2 is review-cleared for the advisory slice. Fresh build implementation tasks should be promoted only after the current review pass/finding results are recorded, unless the user explicitly accepts parallel implementation past pending review gates.

Coordinator review clearance and fresh task promotion - 2026-06-02:

- Movement gate: fetched `origin/main`; verified shared main clean on `main`; verified Reviews B and Reviews A worktrees were clean before movement. Reviews B local provenance commit `f62ed0fa` was path-limited to `docs/live-codex-reviews-2.md` and moved to main as `ec084076`. Reviews A local provenance commit `abf74981` was path-limited to `docs/live-codex-reviews.md` and moved to main as `7609d0e2`.
- Review results: Reviews A passed Build 1 Relay route metadata binding and Build 3 FileMap checkpoint audit with no findings; Reviews B passed Build 4 prompt-payload visibility checklist and Build 5 proof-state preview rendering with no findings.
- Promoted fresh executable build tasks on shared main after review clearance: Build 1 Relay prompt payload evidence binding; Build 2 Session Lifecycle command-plan edge coverage; Build 3 FileMap coverage audit for the clearance/routing checkpoint; Build 4 Relay dispatch hardening implementation checklist; Build 5 Bifrost prompt payload visibility rendering.
- Promoted review queue Active Now blocks: Reviews A polls/reviews the next current-main Ready marker from Build 1/2/3; Reviews B polls/reviews the next current-main Ready marker from Build 4/5. These poll tasks must not commit read-check-only progress.
- Honest seven-lane status: all five build queues now have executable Active tasks and Next Candidate instructions; both review queues have executable polling/review tasks but are waiting for real Ready markers from the fresh build tasks.

Coordinator containment recovery after post-review promotion - 2026-06-02:

- During seven-worktree branch alignment, shared main was found locally ahead with UI/bridge implementation commits plus dirty UI files. No push was performed. The local implementation history and dirty follow-up were preserved on `codex/quarantine-main-impl-7commits-20260601-2215`, ending at `fc678f30` (`Prevent visible bridge restart process storms`).
- Shared main was restored to clean `origin/main` at `0957fdef` after quarantine. Final shared-main check: on `main`, aligned with `origin/main`, no staged files, no dirty files, and no untracked worker artifacts.
- Recovered the interrupted worktree alignment from the Git config-lock collision. All seven assigned worktrees were clean afterward: Build 1 `codex/aligned-build-1-payload-evidence-20260601-2210`; Build 2 `codex/aligned-build-2-command-plan-20260601-2210`; Build 3 `codex/aligned-build-3-filemap-clearance-20260601-2210`; Build 4 `codex/aligned-build-4-dispatch-hardening-checklist-20260601-2210`; Build 5 `codex/aligned-build-5-payload-visibility-20260601-2210`; Reviews A `codex/aligned-reviews-a-poll-20260601-2210`; Reviews B `codex/aligned-reviews-b-poll-20260601-2210`.

Coordinator review clearance and fresh task promotion - 2026-06-02:

- Movement gate for review provenance was paused when shared main became dirty with doc-only UI scope updates in `docs/live-build-5.md` and `docs/ui-integration-checklist.md`. The dirty doc update was preserved on quarantine branch `codex/quarantine-main-dirty-ui-scope-20260601-222036` at `97fcbb34`, then shared main was returned clean/aligned to `origin/main`.
- After the next-wave push, shared main again picked up unapproved UI implementation/status dirt. `index.html` changes were preserved on `codex/quarantine-main-dirty-index-ui-20260601-222547` at `e3cc921c`, `docs/ui-integration-checklist.md` status updates were preserved on `codex/quarantine-main-dirty-ui-checklist-20260601-222601` at `af0ccd65`, and `tests/test_bifrost_cockpit.py` UI reset/reload tests were preserved on `codex/quarantine-main-dirty-ui-tests-20260601-222631` at `4b00cb30`. Shared main was returned clean/aligned after these quarantines.
- After the clean gate was restored, Reviews A local provenance commit `e5ebe6c8` was moved to main as `61798efa`, limited to `docs/live-codex-reviews.md`. Reviews A passed Build 2 command-plan audit evidence, Build 1 Relay dispatch envelope helpers, and Build 3 FileMap dispatch audit with no findings.
