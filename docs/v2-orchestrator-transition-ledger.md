# Meridian V2 Orchestrator Transition Ledger

## Purpose

This file is the shared coordination surface between the current orchestrator and the replacement orchestrator during handoff.

Treat it like a session queue for the new coordinator. The replacement coordinator should read this file first, write short evidence-backed updates here, and only take full ownership after the current orchestrator or user confirms the transition is stable.

## Transition Rules

- The replacement coordinator must work from `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\coordinator-20260601-200614` unless the user assigns a different unique coordinator worktree.
- The replacement coordinator must not write to shared main `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian`.
- The replacement coordinator must not move work between branches/worktrees without verifying shared main is clean and recording the exact scope here.
- The replacement coordinator must not accept read-check-only worker updates as progress.
- The current orchestrator remains responsible for final route approval until this ledger says `Takeover Status: Complete`.

## Takeover Status

Status: In transition.

Owner of final routing decisions: current orchestrator.

Replacement coordinator may:

- Inspect main/coordinator/worktree status.
- Inspect queue docs and recent commits.
- Recommend lane routing or escalation.
- Draft coordinator-only queue updates.
- Record evidence in this ledger.

Replacement coordinator may not yet:

- Approve branch/worktree movement.
- Reset/quarantine shared main contamination.
- Replace active build/review queues without confirmation.
- Mark the V2 coordination goal complete or blocked.

## Required First Check

The replacement coordinator should run these checks and summarize the result in the first open checkpoint below:

```powershell
Set-Location C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian
git fetch origin main
git status --short --branch
git status --porcelain

Set-Location C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\coordinator-20260601-200614
git status --short --branch
git log --oneline -10
```

Then check each active lane:

```powershell
foreach ($dir in @(
  'C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\build-1-v2-relay',
  'C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\build-2-session-lifecycle',
  'C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\build-3-filemap',
  'C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\build-4-aegis',
  'C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\build-5-bifrost',
  'C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\codex-reviews-a',
  'C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\codex-reviews-b'
)) {
  Set-Location $dir
  git status --short --branch
}
```

## Open Checkpoint 1 - Replacement Coordinator Intake

Status: intake recorded and reviewed by current orchestrator.

Current orchestrator note before replacement intake:

- Shared main was clean and aligned with `origin/main` after the handoff commit.
- All seven worker/review lanes were synced to include the handoff and transition ledger.
- Build 1 and Build 2 are clean but still show local ahead history from prior merge/read-check work; do not treat that as current task completion without commit/queue proof.
- Build 3 remains a pressure lane: current top task is FileMap coverage for Relay UI/runtime integration, and `meridian_core/relay_logic_snapshot.py` / `tests/test_relay_logic_snapshot.py` were still not found in FileMap coverage during the coordinator spot check.
- Reviews B remains a pressure lane: current top task is the Relay UI/runtime integration review; it must pass, route a finding, or write a concrete blocker.
- Build 4 remains active on the Relay routing implementation checklist. The checklist file `docs/relay-heartbeat-model-routing-implementation-checklist.md` is not present on `origin/main`. Do not treat `fe0b0138` as checklist completion; it is the separate account-first wrong-scope fallback repair.
- Replacement coordinator should now run the required first check and record intake below this note.

Replacement coordinator should record:

- Shared main status.
- Coordinator worktree status.
- Seven lane statuses.
- Any dirty/conflicted/stale worktree.
- Whether Build 3 and Reviews B have produced completion/blocker evidence.
- Whether Build 4 queue still needs reconciliation.
- Recommended next action.

Replacement coordinator intake:

- Shared main `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian`: fetched, rebased the ledger-only intake clarification after concurrent current-orchestrator updates, and pushed. Shared main was clean/aligned before this record was committed and must remain the only checkout used for this ledger update.
- Coordinator/worktree status snapshot immediately before publishing this final intake wording: coordinator present and clean at HEAD `c81929b2`; Build 1 clean with `ahead 18, behind 5`; Build 2 clean with `ahead 21, behind 5`; Build 3, Build 4, Build 5, Reviews A, and Reviews B all present and clean with `behind 5`. No missing, dirty, or conflicted build/review worktree was observed. The behind counts are a snapshot before publishing this ledger record; the ledger commits themselves can increase those counts until workers sync.
- Build 1 no-merge ahead evidence checked: only `b8405695` is a read-check/idle commit; not accepted as progress on the DeepSeek metadata preset task.
- Build 2 ahead no-merge commits are historical permission-binding work (`6c3a024b`, `d8a05864`, `6e2f2a5f`), not completion of the current restart/resteer recovery test task.
- Build 3 has not completed or blocked the current FileMap task; the top queue task is still the Relay UI/runtime FileMap audit with escalation text. Targeted coverage check found `docs/relay-completeness-audit.md`, `docs/relay-heartbeat-model-routing-logic.md`, and `docs/ui-integration-checklist.md` registered, but no FileMap coverage hits for `meridian_core/relay_logic_snapshot.py`, `tests/test_relay_logic_snapshot.py`, `scripts/meridian-model-bridge.js`, or `index.html`.
- Build 4 corrected handoff is valid: Build 4 is still correctly assigned to create `docs/relay-heartbeat-model-routing-implementation-checklist.md`; that file is absent from `origin/main`, and `fe0b0138` is the separate account-first wrong-scope fallback repair, not checklist completion.
- Build 5 active task remains stale-session recovery action sample rendering; no fresh completion observed.
- Reviews A active task remains waiting to review Build 1 DeepSeek metadata preset after a current-main Ready marker.
- Reviews B has not completed or blocked the Relay UI/runtime integration review; the top queue task still requires pass, focused finding, or concrete blocker with evidence.
- Missing worktrees: none observed among the coordinator, five build lanes, and two review lanes.
- Intake-only conclusion: no branch/worktree movement approved, no worker implementation files touched, no read-check-only updates accepted as progress, and takeover remains in transition. Recommended next action is current-orchestrator review of this intake before any supervised routing.

## Open Checkpoint 2 - Current Orchestrator Review

Status: reviewed; supervised routing approved.

Current orchestrator should review the replacement coordinator's intake and record:

- Accepted findings.
- Corrections.
- Approved route/queue updates.
- Whether replacement coordinator can advance to supervised routing.

Current orchestrator review:

- Intake accepted. The replacement coordinator correctly preserved containment, did not write to shared main, did not approve movement, and did not treat read-check-only/ahead history as progress.
- Correction: after the replacement intake, the current orchestrator fast-forwarded shared main `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian` to `a20d9e0b`; shared main is now aligned with `origin/main` and clean.
- Accepted pressure-lane findings: Build 3 still owes the Relay UI/runtime FileMap audit or a concrete blocker, and Reviews B still owes the Relay UI/runtime review pass/finding/blocker.
- Accepted Build 4 correction: the checklist task remains valid because `docs/relay-heartbeat-model-routing-implementation-checklist.md` is absent from `origin/main`; `fe0b0138` is only the wrong-scope fallback repair.
- Approved supervised routing cycle: replacement coordinator may draft coordinator-scoped queue updates that add path-specific escalation evidence for Build 3 and Reviews B, keep Build 4 on the checklist task, and keep Build 1/2/5 on implement-or-blocker pressure. The replacement coordinator may not approve branch/worktree movement, reset/quarantine main, mark takeover complete, or replace active queues without current-orchestrator/user review.
- Full takeover is not approved yet. Takeover remains `In transition`.

## Open Checkpoint 3 - Supervised Routing Trial

Status: supervised routing cycle recorded; awaiting current orchestrator review.

Replacement coordinator should perform one supervised routing cycle:

- Keep shared main clean.
- Sync stale clean worktrees if needed.
- Draft or apply only coordinator-scoped queue updates.
- Preserve every worker's unique-worktree and no-movement rule.
- Record actions and proof here.

Replacement coordinator supervised routing trial - 2026-06-02:

- Containment gate: fetched `origin/main`; verified shared main `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian` was on `main`, aligned with `origin/main`, and clean before routing. Verified affected worktrees Build 3 and Reviews B were clean before routing.
- Queue update applied to `docs/live-build-3.md`: added a supervised escalation block with path-specific FileMap evidence. Missing coverage evidence named `meridian_core/relay_logic_snapshot.py`, `tests/test_relay_logic_snapshot.py`, `scripts/meridian-model-bridge.js`, and `index.html`; existing coverage noted for the three Relay/UI docs. Required Build 3 to complete registration or write a concrete out-of-scope blocker with command evidence; read-check-only updates explicitly rejected.
- Queue update applied to `docs/live-codex-reviews-2.md`: added a supervised escalation block requiring Reviews B to review the current-main Relay UI/runtime integration and record `Completed / Passed`, `Completed / Finding Routed`, or a concrete blocker. Minimum proof remains `python -m pytest tests/test_relay_logic_snapshot.py -q`; read-check-only updates explicitly rejected.
- Build 4 route held unchanged: it remains correctly assigned to create `docs/relay-heartbeat-model-routing-implementation-checklist.md`; no Build 4 queue edit was needed.
- No branch/worktree movement was approved. No worker implementation files were edited. No shared-main implementation contamination was observed.
- Follow-up needed after current-orchestrator review: fast-forward or otherwise sync the clean affected worker worktrees only if approved/needed so Build 3 and Reviews B can consume these current-main queue updates.

Replacement coordinator sync follow-up - 2026-06-02:

- Current orchestrator review thread was still in progress when checked; no correction had been received yet.
- Thread search did not expose clearly named Build 1-5 / Reviews A-B session threads, so no direct worker-thread prompts were sent.
- Movement gate before sync: fetched `origin/main`; verified shared main on `main`, aligned with `origin/main`, and clean. Verified Build 3, Build 4, Build 5, Reviews A, and Reviews B worktrees were clean and behind-only.
- Fast-forwarded clean behind-only worktrees Build 3, Build 4, Build 5, Reviews A, and Reviews B to `7b086b7f` using `git pull --ff-only origin main`. Build 1 and Build 2 were not synced because they remain clean but divergent with local ahead history.
- Purpose: ensure Build 3 and Reviews B can see the supervised escalation queue updates in their assigned worktrees, and keep Build 4/5/Reviews A current with the corrected handoff/ledger without touching worker implementation files.

Current orchestrator review of supervised routing trial - 2026-06-02:

- Review thread accepted the Open Checkpoint 3 supervised routing trial with no corrections.
- Accepted: Build 3 and Reviews B queue updates are coordinator-scoped, specific, actionable, and reject read-check-only progress; Build 4 was correctly held unchanged.
- Approved next step: Build 3 and Reviews B should execute the queued tasks in their assigned unique worktrees and record pass/finding/blocker evidence.
- Takeover remains incomplete: full takeover still waits on Build 3 and Reviews B evidence plus explicit takeover approval in this ledger.

Replacement coordinator follow-up poll - 2026-06-02:

- Refreshed shared main: clean, on `main`, aligned with `origin/main` at `8257aa19`.
- Rechecked Build 3 and Reviews B queue headers on main. Both still show the supervised escalation blocks as active; neither has recorded pass, finding, completion, or concrete blocker evidence after the sync.
- Fast-forwarded clean behind-only worktrees Build 3, Build 4, Build 5, Reviews A, and Reviews B to `8257aa19`. Build 1 and Build 2 remain clean but divergent with local ahead history and were not moved.
- Thread discovery did not expose clearly named worker/review session threads for Build 1-5 or Reviews A-B, so no direct thread prompt was sent to those sessions.
- Next coordinator action: monitor for Build 3 and Reviews B evidence on their queues. If they remain silent on the next check, route replacement/parallel focused sessions or request current-orchestrator/user approval to replace those lanes; do not accept idle/read-check-only progress.

Replacement coordinator pressure-lane replacement - 2026-06-02:

- Before writing new coordinator state, shared main was found clean but locally ahead by implementation commit `270cede9 Make Relay headers aqua` touching `index.html`. This violated the coordinator-only main rule. The commit was preserved on quarantine branch `codex/quarantine-main-impl-270cede9-20260601-210451`, then shared main was restored clean/aligned to `origin/main` at `54c05552`.
- Build 3 and Reviews B remained silent after the accepted supervised escalation and sync. No pass/finding/completion/blocker evidence was present in their queue headers.
- Launched replacement focused Build 3 FileMap worker thread `019e8649-c8c7-75f3-927c-99c76c4ee255`, constrained to `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\build-3-filemap`, with no shared-main writes or main push allowed.
- Launched replacement focused Reviews B Relay UI/runtime review thread `019e864a-0536-7250-8057-19bf8a8a85b3`, constrained to `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian-Worktrees\codex-reviews-b`, with no shared-main writes or main push allowed.
- Initial thread readback: both replacement sessions are active, verified clean assigned worktrees, and began inspecting the required files. Await local branch commit/verdict evidence before any coordinator movement.

Replacement coordinator pressure-lane evidence - 2026-06-02:

- Additional shared-main containment recovery: local implementation commit `2a697273 Persist active harness panel mode` touching `index.html` was found on shared main, preserved on quarantine branch `codex/quarantine-main-impl-2a697273-20260601-210740`, then shared main was restored clean/aligned to `origin/main` at `7707e50a`.
- Build 3 replacement thread produced local worktree branch commits `4c9060c3` (`chore: Register Relay UI runtime FileMap coverage`) and `969172d0` (`chore: Record Relay UI FileMap audit completion`). Reported proof: `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py -q` passed 46/46 and all four missing paths were registered.
- Reviews B replacement thread produced local worktree branch commit `207a101e` (`Review Relay harness UI integration`). Reported proof: `python -m pytest tests/test_relay_logic_snapshot.py -q` passed 11 tests, bridge self-test passed, and verdict was passed with no findings/blockers.
- Movement status: no worker/review commits have been moved to main yet. Current orchestrator review/approval was requested for a path-limited movement plan covering Build 3 files (`meridian_core/filemap.py`, `docs/FileMap.md`, `tests/test_filemap.py`, `docs/live-build-3.md`) and Reviews B provenance (`docs/live-codex-reviews-2.md`).

Coordinator movement completion - 2026-06-02:

- User clarified there is no separate current-orchestrator session for this handoff; this thread is the coordinator authority. The earlier external-review request is superseded by this coordinator gate check and ledger record.
- Movement gate: fetched `origin/main`; verified shared main `C:\Users\scott\Code\Meridian` was on `main`, aligned with `origin/main` at `b47622ba`, and clean. Verified Build 3 and Reviews B worktrees were present and clean before movement.
- Approved and completed path-limited movement by cherry-picking Build 3 commits `4c9060c3` and `969172d0`, plus Reviews B commit `207a101e`, onto shared main. Movement scope stayed limited to `meridian_core/filemap.py`, `docs/FileMap.md`, `tests/test_filemap.py`, `docs/live-build-3.md`, and `docs/live-codex-reviews-2.md`.
- Proof rerun on shared main after movement: `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py -q` passed 46/46; `python -m pytest tests/test_relay_logic_snapshot.py -q` passed 11/11.
- Result: Build 3 FileMap pressure point is completed and Reviews B Relay UI/runtime review is completed/passed with no routed findings. Takeover remains `In transition` until the remaining lane criteria and explicit approval record are satisfied.

Coordinator routing refresh - 2026-06-02:

- After pushing movement completion to `origin/main` at `407ac602`, refreshed all seven lane worktree statuses. All lanes were present and clean: Build 1 `ahead 18, behind 17`; Build 2 `ahead 21, behind 17`; Build 3 `ahead 2, behind 6`; Build 4 `behind 7`; Build 5 `behind 7`; Reviews A `behind 7`; Reviews B `ahead 1, behind 6`. No dirty, conflicted, or missing worktree was observed.
- Queue update: promoted Build 3's FileMap maintenance candidate to an executable `Active Task`, requiring a concrete missing-file/no-op audit with `python -m pytest tests/test_filemap.py -q` proof. This prevents the completed Relay UI FileMap slice from leaving Build 3 idle.
- Queue update: promoted Reviews B's Build 4/Build 5 Ready-marker polling candidate to `Coordinator Override - Active Now`, with Build 4 checklist review before Build 5 if both become ready. This keeps Reviews B executable after the Relay UI/runtime review pass.
- Build 1, Build 2, Build 4, Build 5, and Reviews A already had executable Active Now tasks plus Next Candidates; their existing routes were left unchanged.
- Takeover remains `In transition`. Remaining pressure is implementation/proof from Build 1, Build 2, Build 4, and Build 5, plus review follow-through as Ready markers land.

## Full Takeover Criteria

The replacement coordinator may take full ownership only when all are true:

- Shared main is clean.
- Coordinator worktree is clean after any handoff commits.
- All seven lanes are clean or have documented blockers.
- Every active build queue has an executable Active Task plus a Next Candidate.
- Every active review queue has an executable Active Task plus a Next Candidate.
- Build 3 and Reviews B pressure points are either completed, routed, or have concrete blockers.
- Build 4 queue inconsistency is reconciled or explicitly routed.
- The user or current orchestrator records takeover approval in this ledger.

## Takeover Approval

Takeover Status: In transition.

Approval record:

- Pending.
