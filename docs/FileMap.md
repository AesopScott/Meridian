# Meridian File Map

This is the living knowledge tracker for important Meridian files.

Use it to quickly understand what each file owns, which harness or architecture area it belongs to, and where to look before editing.

This file should eventually feed Echo/Atlas memory injection so Prime and worker sessions can start with the right repository context instead of rediscovering the codebase every time.

| `docs/polaris-lessons-for-meridian.md` | Architecture memory | Structured lessons from Polaris: what worked, carry-forward principles, and what not to repeat. Includes Relay prompt efficiency (Lesson 16). | n/a | Reference before designing a new harness or major subsystem. |
| `docs/meridian-capabilities-architecture-map.md` | Architecture memory | High-level capability positioning and maturity map. What makes Meridian distinct and where each capability stands today (planned/domain-slice/integrated/needs-hardening). | n/a | Strategic; does not list file paths or class names. Companion to `docs/meridian-capabilities.md`. |

PromptBudgetTier enum, PromptBudget/PromptBudgetPlan dataclasses, prompt_budget_for_risk_tier() generator. | `tests/test_prompt_budget.py` | Integrated: RelayRoute.prompt_budget carries a PromptBudgetPlan for every dispatch. See `docs/relay-prompt-budget-integration-brief.md`. |
