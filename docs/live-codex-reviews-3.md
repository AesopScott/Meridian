# Live Codex Reviews C Queue

This file is the standing queue for a third specialized Codex Reviews session.

Review C exists because review capacity became the bottleneck. It is a bounded specialist lane, not a duplicate of Review A or Review B.

## Coordinator Override - Completed / Passed

Goal: verify the V2 PrimeNextAction human-gate repair and clear or re-route it.

Status: passed by Codex Reviews C on 2026-05-31 15:55 -06:00. Repair commit `39c9ac8` closes the human-gate executability finding without adding live execution, UI automation, session mutation, model calls, filesystem mutation, or approval workflow. No repair routed.

Scope:

- Original Build 2 V2 Prime next-action domain object commit `40def3d`.
- Coordinator repair commit `39c9ac8` for the human-gate executability finding.
- Queue provenance: `docs/live-build-2.md` entries marking the repair completed and awaiting Codex review.

Allowed review files:

- `meridian_core/prime_autonomy.py`
- `tests/test_prime_autonomy.py`
- `docs/live-build-2.md` for provenance only.
- `docs/v2-progress-tracker.md` for tracker implication only if the repair passes.

Proof commands:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_prime_autonomy.py -q`
- `python -m pytest tests/test_prime_autonomy.py tests/test_filemap.py -q`

Review expectations:

- Verify `PrimeNextAction.is_executable()` returns `False` when `human_gate_required` is true, even with no blockers.
- Verify blocker behavior still returns not executable.
- Verify safe non-human-gated actions with no blockers remain executable.
- Verify selectors/constructors preserve immutable/frozen evidence and blocker sets.
- Verify no live execution, UI automation, session mutation, model call, filesystem mutation, or approval workflow was added.
- If clean, record proof and mark the Prime Autonomy contract/runtime implication review-cleared in this queue.
- If findings remain, route a focused repair back to Build 2 with allowed files and tests.

Completion: commit and push only `docs/live-codex-reviews-3.md` unless routing a repair or updating tracker implication after a clean pass.

Review result:

- `PrimeNextAction.is_executable()` returns `False` when `human_gate_required` is true, even with no blockers.
- Blocked actions remain non-executable.
- Safe non-human-gated actions with no blockers remain executable.
- Evidence and blockers remain `frozenset` values through the selectors/constructors, and `PrimeNextAction` remains a frozen dataclass.
- No live execution, UI automation, session mutation, model call, filesystem mutation, or approval workflow was added.

Proof:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_prime_autonomy.py -q` passed with 30 tests.
- `python -m pytest tests/test_prime_autonomy.py tests/test_filemap.py -q` passed with 76 tests.

Tracker implication: `docs/v2-progress-tracker.md` may treat PrimeNextAction as built/review-cleared after repair `39c9ac8`.

No active task. Continue polling for delegated runtime-gate reviews or repair-verification needs.

## Q Polling Source of Truth

When the Polaris `Q` button is enabled for **Codex Reviews C**, the session must read this file first and treat this file as its executable queue. Build queue files are review inputs only: inspect them for `Ready for Codex Review` markers, cadence triggers, commit hashes, and repair status, but do not execute build-lane Active Tasks from a review session.

## Role

Codex Reviews C owns bounded runtime-gate review slices assigned by Prime/Codex when Review A is overloaded.

Default split:

- Review A (`docs/live-codex-reviews.md`) owns broad runtime, package API, tests, behavior, and code-level regression reviews.
- Review B (`docs/live-codex-reviews-2.md`) owns docs, architecture, FileMap, Bifrost, and strategic consistency reviews.
- Review C owns explicitly delegated gate reviews: Mission Boot, Review Console visibility, Relay executor skeletons, Aegis/Relay gate wires, Prime autonomy repairs, and narrow runtime readiness checks.

Review C must declare scope before reviewing. It must not silently broaden into Review A or Review B territory.

## Rules

- Always pull latest `origin/main` before reviewing.
- Do not implement product code.
- Do not edit runtime files, package exports, or tests.
- Own only this review queue plus repair routing into the relevant build queue when actionable findings are found.
- Review completed build slices by commit hash.
- Inspect the target diff and directly necessary supporting files only.
- Run targeted tests for runtime slices.
- Record proofs for every review pass. A pass without proof is not a clearance.
- If there are actionable findings, write a repair Active Task back into the original build lane queue.
- CRITICAL and HIGH findings block the lane until repaired.
- MEDIUM findings should usually be repaired before more work unless intentionally deferred.
- LOW findings may be deferred, but must be recorded.
- Update Obsidian build notes in `G:\My Drive\Obsidian\Meridian_Build` when a review finds or clears important V0 gate issues.

## Review Inputs

Poll these files:

- `docs/live-build-1.md`
- `docs/live-build-2.md`
- `docs/live-codex-reviews.md`

Look for:

- `Ready for Codex Review`
- V0 gate commits awaiting review
- cadence-paused Build 1 or Build 2 work
- repair tasks waiting for verification
- scope notes from Review A that delegate work to Review C

## Checkpoint Ledger

| Build lane | Last reviewed commit | Last reviewed task | Review status | Pending finding / repair | Next action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Build 1 | f56af55 | Prime cockpit snapshot/event domain shape (Round C5) | passed | MEDIUM closed (e89df81): cockpit_state.py + test_cockpit_state.py registered in filemap.py:526/561 and FileMap.md | Await next Ready for Codex Review marker |
| Build 2 | 989366f | V0 prime_console / prime_status / route_to_console (Round C1) | passed | LOW deferred: route_to_console type-vs-semantics doc note | Build 2 cadence cleared for three-commit window ending at 989366f; continue polling |

```

Minimum proof expectations:

- Runtime/code slices: targeted tests plus diff inspection.
- CLI slices: focused CLI tests plus deterministic output inspection.
- Review Console slices: status/type/provenance inspection plus targeted tests.
- Relay executor slices: dispatch-boundary tests proving only lane payload text reaches the injected callable.
- Repair verification: original finding, repair commit, and test/reference evidence that the finding is closed.

## Findings

```text
2026-05-30 13:58 MDT - Build 1 commit 190e527; severity: none; file: meridian_core/relay_executor.py; finding: V0 gate intent satisfied — only lane.payload crosses boundary, per-lane exception isolation present, immutable summary; action: clear
2026-05-30 13:58 MDT - Build 2 commit e800c03; severity: none; file: meridian_core/cli.py; finding: mission load failure path surfaces clearly via stdout without raising; deterministic output verified; no persistence/UI introduced; action: clear
2026-05-30 13:58 MDT - Build 2 commit 989366f; severity: LOW; file: meridian_core/review_console.py; finding: route_to_console accepts any ReviewConsoleItemType but always creates a non-promptable, INFO-severity, ACKNOWLEDGE-only item regardless of type — callers passing APPROVAL_GATE or PLAN_REVIEW via this helper get an informational item, not the canonical gate semantics from make_approval_gate / make_plan_review_item. Acceptable for V0 visibility surface (helper is a router, not a gate factory) and Review Console queue invariants (promptable/requires_response/status) remain intact; recommend documenting in docstring or narrowing item_type to SYSTEM_FINDING in V1; action: defer
2026-05-30 15:05 MDT - Build 1 commit 0e990df; severity: none; file: meridian_core/relay_executor.py; finding: Relay execution summary to Aegis proof trail is provider-neutral, prompt-lean, and proof-blocking for execution errors; action: clear
2026-05-30 15:05 MDT - Build 1 commit 7c75f43; severity: none; file: meridian_core/relay_executor.py; finding: Aegis pre-dispatch proof gate blocks tier-3+ dispatch before model calls and leaves lower tiers unblocked; action: clear
2026-05-30 15:51 MDT - Build 1 commit 653488b; severity: none; file: meridian_core/model_adapter.py; finding: Provider-neutral Model Adapter contract is payload-only, env-safe before live transport, and has no vendor/account automation; action: clear
2026-05-30 15:51 MDT - Build 1 commit 653488b; severity: none; file: meridian_core/relay_executor.py; finding: Relay executor preserves payload-only dispatch and Aegis pre-dispatch blocking with the adapter boundary; action: clear
2026-05-31 01:10 MDT - Build 1 commit f56af55; severity: none; file: meridian_core/cockpit_state.py; finding: cockpit_state domain shape is stdlib-only, immutable, dependency-free, no I/O or prompt-injection surface; lane sorting, event filtering, summary counts all correct; action: clear
2026-05-31 01:10 MDT - Build 1 commit f56af55; severity: MEDIUM; file: meridian_core/cockpit_state.py + tests/test_cockpit_state.py; finding: neither file registered in meridian_core/filemap.py or docs/FileMap.md; action: route to Build 3 FileMap repair
```

## Archived Prior Active Task - Do Not Execute

Prior active task, already superseded by later review records and tracker state:

Goal: perform Codex Reviews C Round C6 for Build 1 `3cdc74d`.

Scope trigger:

- Coordinator completed the V2 Aegis CognitionPolicy domain model for Build 1.
- Build 1 queue marks commit `3cdc74d` Ready for Codex Review.
- Queue checkpoint commit `8826909` only stamps the review-ready marker; review the product slice in `3cdc74d`.

Round C6 scope:

- Build lane: Build 1
- Commit under review: `3cdc74d`
- Provenance/checkpoint commit: `8826909`
- Files: `meridian_core/cognition_policy.py`, `tests/test_cognition_policy.py`, `docs/live-build-1.md`
- Supporting files allowed for context only: `meridian_core/aegis.py`, `meridian_core/relay.py`, `meridian_core/risk.py`
- Tests to run: `python -m pytest tests/test_cognition_policy.py tests/test_aegis.py -q`

Review expectations:

- Verify risk tiers map to the expected cognition lanes, proof requirements, review requirements, and human gate requirements.
- Verify missing or blocking Aegis proof prevents Relay dispatch when proof is required.
- Verify Tier 2 remains review-oriented without accidentally requiring a proof gate.
- Verify the policy is deterministic and does not call models, mutate Relay executor behavior, export package API, or edit FileMap.
- Record findings with severity. Route actionable repairs to Build 1 if needed.
- If clean, mark Build 1 `3cdc74d` passed and leave package API/FileMap follow-ups to Build 2/Build 3.

Stale prior Round C5 status follows.

Round C5 complete at 2026-05-31 01:10 MDT. Build 1 `f56af55` passed with MEDIUM deferred to Build 3 FileMap.

Proof:

- `python -m pytest tests/test_cockpit_state.py -q` -> 25 passed in 0.07s.
- `python -m pytest -q` -> 941 passed in 0.71s.
- Diff inspection confirmed cockpit_state.py is stdlib-only, frozen dataclasses, helpers return new objects, no I/O surface.
- MEDIUM closed (e89df81): cockpit_state.py and tests/test_cockpit_state.py registered in FileMap (filemap.py:526/561 and FileMap.md).

No active task. Codex Reviews C is idle - continue polling for Build 1/Build 2 runtime-gate review markers.

Stale Round C5 task follows.

Goal: perform Codex Reviews C Round C5 for Build 1 cockpit-state domain shape.

Scope trigger:

- Build 1 completed the Prime cockpit snapshot/event domain shape for V1 Bifrost.

Immediate scope:

- Build 1 commit `f56af55` - `meridian_core/cockpit_state.py` and `tests/test_cockpit_state.py`.
- Build 1 queue marker `7e81bf6` is provenance only; do not review it as product code.

Allowed review files:

- `meridian_core/cockpit_state.py`
- `tests/test_cockpit_state.py`
- `docs/live-build-1.md` for provenance only.

Required proof:

- Inspect `git show f56af55 -- meridian_core/cockpit_state.py tests/test_cockpit_state.py`.
- Run or verify:
  - `python -m pytest tests/test_cockpit_state.py -q`
  - `python -m pytest -q`
- Confirm the module is dependency-free, frozen/immutable where appropriate, and has no filesystem, CLI, browser, or prompt-injection behavior.
- Confirm lane sorting, progress filtering, and summary counts match the V1 cockpit need for typed summaries rather than raw queue-file/log content.
- Confirm the tests cover sorting, filtering, immutability, and summary counts.
- Check whether `meridian_core/cockpit_state.py` and `tests/test_cockpit_state.py` need FileMap registration. If yes, route a Build 3 FileMap task instead of editing FileMap here.

Output:

- Declare Round C5 scope.
- Update Review Log, Proof Log, Findings, and Active Task status.
- If clean, mark Build 1 commit `f56af55` passed and Build 1 unblocked.
- If actionable findings exist, route repair work to Build 1.

Stale prior idle status:

No active task. Codex Reviews C is idle - continue polling for Build 1/Build 2 runtime-gate review markers.

Stale prior Round C3 task follows.

Goal: perform Codex Reviews C Round C3 for Build 1 `653488b`.

Round C3 scope:

- Build 1 commit `653488b`
- Queue marker commit `a629d23` for provenance only
- Files:
  - `meridian_core/model_adapter.py`
  - `meridian_core/relay_executor.py`
  - `tests/test_model_adapter.py`
  - `tests/test_relay_executor.py`
  - `docs/live-build-1.md` only for completion/provenance
- Focus:
  - provider-neutral Model Adapter contract
  - payload-only adapter boundary
  - env-safe missing-configuration failure before live transport calls
  - no vendor SDK dependency
  - no account-based automation
  - Relay executor still calls `model_call(lane.payload)` only
  - Aegis blocking evidence still prevents adapter/model calls before dispatch
- Tests:
  - `python -m pytest tests/test_model_adapter.py tests/test_relay_executor.py -q`
  - `python -m pytest tests/test_aegis.py tests/test_relay_executor.py -q`

Do not review unrelated Build 2/3/4/5 work in this round. Do not implement product code.

Stale prior Round C2 completion follows.

Round C2 complete at 2026-05-30 15:05 MDT. Build 1 `0e990df` and `7c75f43` passed with no actionable findings.

Stale prior Round C2 task follows.

Goal: perform Codex Reviews C Round C2 for Build 1 `0e990df` and `7c75f43`.

Round C2 scope:

- Build 1 commit `0e990df`
- Build 1 commit `7c75f43`
- Files: `meridian_core/relay_executor.py`, `tests/test_relay_executor.py`
- Focus: RelayExecutionSummary -> Aegis ProofTrail conversion, proof-blocking semantics for lane errors, pre-dispatch proof gate enforcement for tier-3/4 lanes, prompt payload/packet metadata non-leakage, provider-neutral boundary preservation
- Tests: `python -m pytest tests/test_relay_executor.py -q` and `python -m pytest tests/test_aegis.py tests/test_relay_executor.py -q`

Do not review unrelated Build 2/3/4/5 work in this round.

Stale prior trigger text follows.

Scope trigger:

- Build 2 marks `prime_approve <item-id>` Ready for Codex Review, or
- Build 1 marks Relay + Aegis gate wire Ready for Codex Review.

Until a trigger appears:

- Poll `docs/live-build-1.md`, `docs/live-build-2.md`, and `docs/live-codex-reviews.md`.
- Do not execute build-lane tasks.
- Do not review Build 3/4/5 docs/architecture work; Reviews B owns that.
- Append read checks only when no trigger exists.

When a trigger appears:

- Before reviewing, verify this session is operating in its own unique worktree/path and is not sharing the same working tree as another active Build or Review session. Record the resolved path in this queue. If the session is not on a unique worktree, stop and report the worktree collision instead of reviewing.
- Pull latest `origin/main` in your unique worktree before reviewing.
- Declare Round C2 scope before reviewing.
- Review only the target commit diff and directly necessary supporting files.
- For Build 2 `prime_approve`, run `python -m pytest tests/test_cli.py -q`.
- For Build 1 Relay + Aegis gate wire, run `python -m pytest tests/test_relay_executor.py -q` and, if practical, `python -m pytest tests/test_aegis.py tests/test_relay_executor.py -q`.
- Record proof before passing.
- Route repairs back to the originating build lane if actionable.

Stale prior status:

Round C1 complete at 2026-05-30 13:58 MDT. All three commits passed:

- Build 1 `190e527` clear
- Build 2 `e800c03` clear
- Build 2 `989366f` clear with LOW finding deferred (route_to_console type-vs-semantics doc note)

Build 2 cadence cleared for the three-commit window ending at `989366f`. No repairs routed. Idle — polling docs/live-build-1.md, docs/live-build-2.md, docs/live-codex-reviews.md every 30 seconds for next delegated assignment.

Durable proof trail also captured in Obsidian: `G:\My Drive\Obsidian\Meridian_Build\2026-05-30 Codex Reviews C Round C1 V0 Gate Clearance.md`.

## Coordinator Addendum - Round C5 FileMap Repair Closed

2026-05-31 02:35 MDT - Round C5 repair closure verified.

- Original finding: Build 1 `f56af55` cockpit_state domain shape passed, but `meridian_core/cockpit_state.py` and `tests/test_cockpit_state.py` needed FileMap registration.
- Closure: Build 3/FileMap work in `ca6f55f` + `e89df81` registers the cockpit_state module and its test file.
- Proof: `python -m pytest tests/test_bifrost_cockpit.py tests/test_filemap.py -q` -> 95/95 passed.
- Result: Build 1 `f56af55` remains passed; MEDIUM FileMap finding closed; no remaining Build 1 repair.

Build 1 | 3cdc74d + b99ce1d | V2 Aegis CognitionPolicy domain shape + policy-aware Relay executor wrapper (Round C6) | passed | none | Await next Ready for Codex Review marker

**Read Checks:**
2026-05-31 05:05 MDT - Codex Reviews C checked queue; status: running; notes: Active Task found - V2 Aegis CognitionPolicy domain model + policy-aware Relay executor wrapper; starting review of Build 1 commits 3cdc74d + b99ce1d
2026-05-31 05:10 MDT - Codex Reviews C checked queue; status: complete; notes: Round C6 complete - 3cdc74d + b99ce1d passed; 102 + 157 targeted tests passed (combined 259); no actionable findings; tier routing to lanes, proof blocking, human gate, and Tier 2 review-only all verified correct

**Review Log:**
2026-05-31 05:08 MDT - Reviewed Build 1 commit 3cdc74d; result: pass; tests: tests/test_cognition_policy.py + tests/test_aegis.py 102/102 pass; notes: CognitionPolicy tier mapping correct (Tier 0→LOCAL, Tier 1→BUILDER, Tier 2→BUILDER+REVIEWER, Tier 3→BUILDER+REVIEWER+VERIFIER, Tier 4→all+HUMAN); Tier 2 requires review but no proof; Tier 3+ require proof; Tier 4 requires human gate; no model calls, no mutations, no API code
2026-05-31 05:08 MDT - Reviewed Build 1 commit b99ce1d; result: pass; tests: tests/test_relay_executor.py + tests/test_cognition_policy.py + tests/test_aegis.py 157/157 pass; notes: new execute_relay_dispatch_plan_with_policy wraps policy evaluation before dispatch; Tier 3 clean proof allows dispatch; Tier 4 clean proof still requires human gate (blocks before model_call); Tier 2 still dispatches without proof (review-oriented); RelayProofGateError raised for policy blocks before any model call; payload-only boundary preserved; Relay stays provider-neutral

**Proof Log:**
2026-05-31 05:08 MDT - Proof for Build 1 commit 3cdc74d; proof type: test; evidence: python -m pytest tests/test_cognition_policy.py tests/test_aegis.py -q -> 102 passed in 0.33s; result: pass
2026-05-31 05:08 MDT - Proof for Build 1 commit 3cdc74d; proof type: diff; evidence: cognition_policy.py imports only aegis/relay/risk modules; cognition_policy_for_tier returns frozen CognitionPolicy with correct lane tuples per tier; evaluate_cognition_policy calls ProofTrail.blocking() only if policy.requires_proof is True; Tier 2 has requires_proof=False; Tier 3+ have requires_proof=True; result: pass
2026-05-31 05:08 MDT - Proof for Build 1 commit 3cdc74d; proof type: reference; evidence: rg found only import statements and enum/dataclass definitions; no cognition_policy calls to Relay executor, no model calls, no exports to package API; result: pass
2026-05-31 05:08 MDT - Proof for Build 1 commit b99ce1d; proof type: test; evidence: python -m pytest tests/test_relay_executor.py tests/test_cognition_policy.py tests/test_aegis.py -q -> 157 passed in 0.29s; result: pass
2026-05-31 05:08 MDT - Proof for Build 1 commit b99ce1d; proof type: diff; evidence: relay_executor.py imports evaluate_cognition_policy; new function execute_relay_dispatch_plan_with_policy calls evaluate_cognition_policy before any model call; if policy_result.can_dispatch is False, raises RelayProofGateError with blocking_reasons before calling execute_relay_dispatch_plan; result: pass
2026-05-31 05:08 MDT - Proof for Build 1 commit b99ce1d; proof type: reference; evidence: execute_relay_dispatch_plan_with_policy calls execute_relay_dispatch_plan(plan, model_call, proof_trail) only after policy allows; _assert_proof_gate_clear still checks tier < 3 and blocks on tier 3+ with blocking proof; Relay executor preserves payload-only boundary; result: pass

**Findings:**
2026-05-31 05:08 MDT - Build 1 commit 3cdc74d; severity: none; file: meridian_core/cognition_policy.py; finding: V2 Aegis CognitionPolicy domain model is deterministic, tier-routable, proof-aware, and tier-2-review-only; Tier 3+ block dispatch on missing/blocking proof before Relay executor; Tier 4 blocks on missing human gate approval; action: clear
2026-05-31 05:08 MDT - Build 1 commit b99ce1d; severity: none; file: meridian_core/relay_executor.py; finding: policy-aware Relay executor wrapper correctly integrates CognitionPolicy checks before model calls; RelayProofGateError raised before any dispatch on policy block; existing executor functions unchanged; payload-only boundary preserved; Relay stays provider-neutral; action: clear

**Repair Routing:**
2026-05-31 05:08 MDT - No repair routed for Round C6 — Build 1 3cdc74d and b99ce1d clear; cognition_policy domain shape passed; policy-aware executor wrapper passed; no actionable findings; tier routing, proof blocking, human gate, and Tier 2 review-only all correct; Relay executor payload-only boundary preserved.
