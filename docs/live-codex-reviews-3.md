# Live Codex Reviews C Queue

This file is the standing queue for a third specialized Codex Reviews session.

Review C exists because review capacity became the bottleneck. It is a bounded specialist lane, not a duplicate of Review A or Review B.

## Q Polling Source of Truth

When the Polaris `Q` button is enabled for **Codex Reviews C**, the session must read this file first and treat this file as its executable queue. Build queue files are review inputs only: inspect them for `Ready for Codex Review` markers, cadence triggers, commit hashes, and repair status, but do not execute build-lane Active Tasks from a review session.

## Role

Codex Reviews C owns V0 runtime-gate review slices assigned by Prime/Codex when Review A is overloaded.

Default split:

- Review A (`docs/live-codex-reviews.md`) owns broad runtime, package API, tests, behavior, and code-level regression reviews.
- Review B (`docs/live-codex-reviews-2.md`) owns docs, architecture, FileMap, Bifrost, and strategic consistency reviews.
- Review C owns explicitly delegated V0 gate reviews: Mission Boot, Review Console visibility, Relay executor skeletons, Aegis/Relay gate wires, and narrow runtime readiness checks.

Review C must declare scope before reviewing. It must not silently broaden into Review A or Review B territory.

## Rules

- Always pull latest `origin/main` before reviewing.
- Do not implement product code.
- Do not edit runtime files, package exports, or tests.
- Own only this review queue plus repair routing into the relevant build queue when actionable findings are found.
- Review completed build slices by commit hash.
- Inspect the target diff and directly necessary supporting files only.
- Run targeted tests for runtime slices.
- Record proofs for every review pass. A pass without proof is not a clearance.
- If there are actionable findings, write a repair Active Task back into the original build lane queue.
- CRITICAL and HIGH findings block the lane until repaired.
- MEDIUM findings should usually be repaired before more work unless intentionally deferred.
- LOW findings may be deferred, but must be recorded.
- Update Obsidian build notes in `G:\My Drive\Aesop Academy\Obsidian\Meridian_Build` when a review finds or clears important V0 gate issues.

## Review Inputs

Poll these files:

- `docs/live-build-1.md`
- `docs/live-build-2.md`
- `docs/live-codex-reviews.md`

Look for:

- `Ready for Codex Review`
- V0 gate commits awaiting review
- cadence-paused Build 1 or Build 2 work
- repair tasks waiting for verification
- scope notes from Review A that delegate work to Review C

## Checkpoint Ledger

| Build lane | Last reviewed commit | Last reviewed task | Review status | Pending finding / repair | Next action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Build 1 | 190e527 | V0 Relay executor skeleton (Round C1) | passed | none | continue polling for delegated work |
| Build 2 | 989366f | V0 prime_console / prime_status / route_to_console (Round C1) | passed | LOW deferred: route_to_console type-vs-semantics doc note | Build 2 cadence cleared for three-commit window ending at 989366f; continue polling |

## Proof Log

```text
2026-05-30 13:58 MDT - Proof for Build 1 commit 190e527; proof type: diff+test; evidence: relay_executor.py line 67 calls model_call(lane.payload) only; tests/test_relay_executor.py TestMetadataNotPassedToModelCall asserts received payload equals lane.payload and excludes packet metadata; TestExceptionConvertedToError verifies partial failure leaves other lanes intact; pytest 26 passed in 0.07s; result: pass
2026-05-30 13:58 MDT - Proof for Build 1 commit 190e527; proof type: reference; evidence: no imports of httpx/requests/anthropic/openai/google/credentials in meridian_core/relay_executor.py; Protocol-typed ModelCallFn is the only execution boundary; result: pass
2026-05-30 13:58 MDT - Proof for Build 2 commit e800c03; proof type: diff+test; evidence: cli.py prime_wake catches MissionLoadError and prints "Mission load failed: <exc>"; TestPrimeWakeMissionFailure covers missing/corrupt mission paths without raising; test_output_is_deterministic confirms byte-identical output across two calls; pytest 24 passed in 0.20s; result: pass
2026-05-30 13:58 MDT - Proof for Build 2 commit e800c03; proof type: reference; evidence: prime_wake uses only Path/print/load_mission/sample data + run_decision_loop + build_wake_brief — no file writes, no network, no Bifrost surface introduced; result: pass
2026-05-30 13:58 MDT - Proof for Build 2 commit 989366f; proof type: diff+test; evidence: route_to_console preserves ReviewConsoleItem default status PENDING, uses canonical ReviewConsoleAction.ACKNOWLEDGE, routes through ReviewConsoleQueue.enqueue (sequence preserved); _CONSOLE is module-level in-memory ReviewConsoleQueue with no persistence path; prime_console reads via q.pending() in deterministic insertion order; TestPrimeConsole/TestPrimeStatus/TestRouteToConsole cover type/status/provenance/empty-queue determinism (all pass); tests/test_review_console.py 85 passed in 0.09s confirms underlying queue semantics intact; result: pass
2026-05-30 13:58 MDT - Proof for Build 2 commit 989366f; proof type: manual; evidence: prime_status delegates to prime_wake + prime_console without new state; severity color mapping is a local pure helper; no durable persistence (no open()/sqlite/json.dump) introduced; result: pass
```

Minimum proof expectations:

- Runtime/code slices: targeted tests plus diff inspection.
- CLI slices: focused CLI tests plus deterministic output inspection.
- Review Console slices: status/type/provenance inspection plus targeted tests.
- Relay executor slices: dispatch-boundary tests proving only lane payload text reaches the injected callable.
- Repair verification: original finding, repair commit, and test/reference evidence that the finding is closed.

## Findings

```text
2026-05-30 13:58 MDT - Build 1 commit 190e527; severity: none; file: meridian_core/relay_executor.py; finding: V0 gate intent satisfied — only lane.payload crosses boundary, per-lane exception isolation present, immutable summary; action: clear
2026-05-30 13:58 MDT - Build 2 commit e800c03; severity: none; file: meridian_core/cli.py; finding: mission load failure path surfaces clearly via stdout without raising; deterministic output verified; no persistence/UI introduced; action: clear
2026-05-30 13:58 MDT - Build 2 commit 989366f; severity: LOW; file: meridian_core/review_console.py; finding: route_to_console accepts any ReviewConsoleItemType but always creates a non-promptable, INFO-severity, ACKNOWLEDGE-only item regardless of type — callers passing APPROVAL_GATE or PLAN_REVIEW via this helper get an informational item, not the canonical gate semantics from make_approval_gate / make_plan_review_item. Acceptable for V0 visibility surface (helper is a router, not a gate factory) and Review Console queue invariants (promptable/requires_response/status) remain intact; recommend documenting in docstring or narrowing item_type to SYSTEM_FINDING in V1; action: defer
```

## Repair Routing Log

```

## Active Task

Round C1 complete at 2026-05-30 13:58 MDT. All three commits passed:

Build 2 cadence cleared for the three-commit window ending at `989366f`. No repairs routed. Idle — polling docs/live-build-1.md, docs/live-build-2.md, docs/live-codex-reviews.md every 30 seconds for next delegated assignment.

Durable proof trail also captured in Obsidian: `G:\My Drive\Aesop Academy\Obsidian\Meridian_Build\2026-05-30 Codex Reviews C Round C1 V0 Gate Clearance.md`.
